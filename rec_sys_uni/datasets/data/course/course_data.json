What is the nature of scientific progress? Can we rationally decide between scientific viewpoints? In what ways are the social sciences similar to or different from the natural sciences? The course presents an introduction to major issues in the philosophy of science. It can be divided into four parts. In the first, we will deal with traditional positions on the objectivity and methodology of science, like those of logical empiricism. The second focuses on objections to this received view as formulated by critical rationalism and by Thomas Kuhn\u2019s paradigm theory. Kuhn\u2019s theory revolutionized thinking about scientific knowledge and led to the so-called sociological and historical turn in the philosophy of science. The course then addresses two fundamental problems in the field: \u2018Do our theories describe reality?\u2019 (The problem of realism) and \u2018Do we now have better knowledge than in the past?\u2019 (The problem of cognitive progress). In the final part of the course, problems in the philosophy of the social sciences will take center stage: How do the social sciences explain and predict events? Does the method of understanding present an alternative methodology for social science? And finally, what is the role of social science in society.",

We are not concerned with what people claim to believe, but rather with the underpinning structures, values, and ideas that shape how we live together. We are concerned with how the language and concepts that people use come to define who they are. In other words, we don't have ideas, ideas have us.

It explores how cultural processes and artifacts are produced, distributed, and consumed, and traces the diverse ways in which people shape and transform culture particularly in relation to issues of identity, difference, and power. In contrast to more traditional approaches to culture, Cultural Studies focuses not merely on 'elevated' cultural objects such as 'great' works of art and literature, but also - and primarily - deals with more mundane cultural phenomena. Addressing topics that range from fashion advertisements to Instagram, and from science fiction to Lady Gaga, Cultural Studies zooms in on seemingly familiar, yet highly complex, practices of everyday life. \n\nThis course introduces you to the key thinkers, topics, and critical frameworks in Cultural Studies. It starts with some of the foundational texts and formative debates within the field, most notably the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Stuart Hall, associated with the Frankfurt School and Birmingham School respectively. Subsequently, we will take a closer look at several topical debates and conceptual approaches within contemporary Cultural Studies. We will address themes such as consumer culture, advertising, and social networks; the power and politics of representation; material culture and identity; cultural performances of gender; and the transnational cultural flows of globalization. By reading the work of major theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman, Henry Giroux, and Joanna Zylinska, you will familiarize yourself with a variety of critical approaches to cultural theory. Lastly, by looking at the interrelated topics of posthumanism, art, and technoscience, the final tasks of the course will explore some of the most stirring debates within Cultural Studies today, setting out new directions for the future development of the field.",

        "desc": "What do Europeans have in common? Part of the answer to this question is their law. Currently, approximately 50% of all new legislation in the member states of the European Union has a non-national, European origin. This international outlook on law in Europe is not a new phenomenon. Even when concentrating on the so-called 'national laws' of the various European nations, it must be admitted that these laws find a strong foundation in a non-national, truly European tradition. This tradition dates back to the Middle Ages.\n\nSince it is the conviction of the course coordinator that a true understanding of the growing importance of the European institutions and policies can only be achieved by understanding the common legal history of Europe, the present course concentrates on this shared (legal) past. In doing so, it takes as its focal point the ius commune, i.e. the common, scholarly European approach to the law that originated in the Middle Ages and that was strongly based on Roman Law. This medieval tradition forms the common ground on which the present national legal systems in Europe have developed. It has strongly contributed to the creation of the idea of a common European culture.\n\nIn a manner that is highly relevant for an audience of non-lawyers and lawyers alike, the course starts with discussing Roman Law. The so-called Corpus Iuris Civilis will be used as the point of departure since most of what we know about Roman Law derives from this compilation of legal materials that was made in the 6th century AD on the orders of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. The texts that this emperor included in his collection were the product of a thousand years of unbroken legal development. During this millennium, roughly from 500 BC to 550 AD, Rome expanded from a small city-state to a world empire. While Roman law was adapted to cope with the changing society, the idea was maintained that it was essentially the same law that had been part of the early Roman way of life.\n\nThe course will also concentrate on the different approach to the law that existed and still exists in Anglo-American jurisdictions. It will try to explain the legal differences today between continental Europe and the British Isles. Additionally, some elements of American legal history will be studied. In doing so, the many similarities that lie beneath the seemingly radically different outward appearance of law in Anglo-American jurisdictions will come to light. This exercise will demonstrate that Anglo-American law is not so different from continental European law as some writers would like us to believe. The course will conclude with a study of a selection of similarities and differences that exist in today\u2019s European legal landscape.",

Moreover, you are encouraged to look for additional examples of poems and songs to discuss and analyze in class. In this course, you will learn how to interpret poetry and popular music in a systematic and sophisticated way, and to write an in-depth analysis of a song or poem. The focus rests with the analysis of the lyrics or 'text' of the poems and songs. First, you will learn how to make use of insights and tools from literary theory in order to find out how (specific) poems work, which effects they evoke, and what they mean. You will also learn how to apply these tools to the analysis of song texts. In this course, we use a broad definition of pop songs, focusing on contemporary popular music, which means including other genres than just conventional pop music, such as rap, hip-hop, and rock. We will also pay some (albeit limited) attention to musical aspects - such as rhythm - of the songs at hand, to see how they interact with the lyrics. Once you have become familiar with the analysis of the lyrics, we will expand our focus to include an analysis of performance (including music videos) in the last week of the course. In this course, you will also experience the creative process that underlies all poetry and song, in a variety of ways: - you will learn to recite or sing a poem or song; - you will hear from experienced artists how they approach writing a poem or song; - you will write a poem or a song of your own.

What have been the decisive common experiences that have fostered a sense of European community and identity, and how have they evolved over time? Tracing those events and experiences in the past that have helped to shape some sense of European community and identity means establishing the factors that have contributed to the difference between Europe and the non-European world. The concept of identity logically consists of two components: the notion of historical continuity and a marked sense of difference between the \"in-group\" and one or more significant others. If we accept that there is some sort of European identity, albeit complex and multifaceted, we should ask which factors have generated it. To put it more specifically: Which factors contributed to Europe's Sonderweg in world history? Or, to use the words of one author, the historian E.L. Jones: how did \"the European miracle\" come about?\n\nFrom the angle of world history, the European experience constitutes a major deviation from an almost universal pattern of social and political organization. Europe is the first region in the world that has changed into a large-scale industrial and urban society. This so-called process of modernization has turned European civilization into something of a historical anomaly - the kind of anomaly, however, that forced itself on other continents, thus becoming a new kind of standard in the end after all. To ask for the factors that have contributed to the modern sense of European community and identity is, at least for a large part, to ask for the factors that have produced this phenomenon of modernization, including the blatant economic disparities between European civilization (including North-America) and the rest of the world.",

We will explore various aspects and concepts such as genre, plot, beginnings and endings, characters, settings, point of view, narration, texture and pace, style, and reflect on the dynamic relationship between the author, the text, and the reader. Combining academic analysis with hands-on creative writing, this course will offer you a deeper understanding of narrative techniques and how they convey meaning. Through rewriting stories, you will gain insight into literary theories and concepts, and simultaneously enhance your own writing skills. Peer and tutor feedback will play a vital role in this course. The collection of short stories we explore may vary each year, but it aims to encompass a diverse range of stories and authors.

First, a historical context will be presented on the political and ideological ambitions of the Enlightenment (enlightened despotism, Voltaire at the court of Frederick the Great, censorship, and the diffusion of the Enlightenment). Secondly, the opposed approach to 'Nature' will be introduced, including the influence of Newton, the rise of modern science, the Encyclop\u00e9die vs. Romantic science (e.g. Goethe\u2019s criticism of Newton\u2019s Theory of Colour), and the role of the arts in the new approach to Nature (such as landscape painting and romantic poetry). Then, the changes in the visual arts will illustrate continuity and discontinuity in cultural history (Romanticism and Neo-Classicism). In the fourth place, human subjectivity in the Enlightenment (based on Lockean psychology and self-love) will be confronted with new approaches to the romantic soul (the unconsciousness, irrationality, Weltschmerz). This will also be discussed with an analysis of the famous movie Dangerous Liaisons (Stephen Frears, 1988). Finally, discussions about morals and politics will be presented (Rousseau, the Social Contract, the slogans of the French Revolution vs. Romantic values concerning the State and personal relationships like love and friendship, nationalism).",

Critical of conventions and traditions, they regarded art as a revolutionary means to social, political, cultural, and intellectual emancipation and progress. Through what has been called the \"shock of the new,\" by making tabula rasa with the existing, art was to create a better world. Were it not for the fact that art effectively served the ideologies of both the socialist and fascist totalitarianisms of the last century, such radical ambitions might even sound a bit na\u00efve, nowadays. Indeed, as yesterday's future has become today's past, the utopias of a bygone era seem to have been disappointed, at last - or have they not? Do we need to rescue avant-garde virtues and ideals for the sake of the relevance of contemporary art? What precisely is the legacy of the modern avant-garde besides its success on the global art market? In the early 21st century and under the spell of a \"new spirit of capitalism,\" is there any hope left for effective artistic critique? Or do current \"economies of enrichment\" simply reduce the value of art to financial speculation? This course considers histories and theories of modern and contemporary art. It provides an overview of the heterogeneous and experimental development of modern and contemporary art. Artistic responses to society, politics, science, and technology are discussed.

However, in this course, we take a different approach to heritage. We don't limit it to material culture or isolated ecosystems that need protection. Instead, we see heritage as human practices that hold values like authenticity, integrity, and sustainability. One of the main ideas of this course is that heritage, whether tangible or intangible, always involves the creation and recreation of various political, technological, and ethical relationships and meanings related to the past, present, and future. In other words, heritage is not just a passive thing, it is something that is constantly being done.\n\nIn this course, we ask questions like who is involved in heritage preservation, what do they do, how do they do it, and why? We will explore the histories, theories, and practices of preserving both natural and cultural heritage. We will also learn about the national laws and international agreements that exist to protect heritage, and we will examine the emergence of new economic systems centered around the value of heritage. Additionally, we will have the opportunity to meet with experts and managers from various heritage fields, as well as visit governmental and non-governmental heritage institutions.\n\nBy critically analyzing how heritage values are constructed and legitimized, this course aims to place contemporary heritage practices within the broader global context of heritage. This context consists of administrative systems, technical infrastructures, and value systems that revolve around contested notions of heritage and that may go beyond the boundaries of individual nations. As one of the foundational texts of critical heritage studies from the 1980s puts it, \"The Past is a Foreign Country.\" But in this anthropocentric 21st century, where can we actually find \"the past,\" if it even exists at all? In times marked by global humanitarian and ecological crises, where there are conflicting appeals for both development and conservation, is there still room for nostalgia? And how can we honor the diversity of our pasts while preserving the potential heritage futures we have today? These are questions we will explore in this course.",

Yet the Middle Ages also gave us some of the most impressive feats of human engineering as well as timeless works of art and literature. More importantly, the Medieval period heralded momentous societal changes that have shaped our current society. In late 2019, Chris Jones, Conor Kostick, and Klaus Oschema published an edited volume titled 'Making the Medieval relevant' in which they stated that the Medieval past informs the present in a myriad of ways. This course aims to do exactly that, making the Middle Ages relevant by drawing parallels between modern-day societal, economic, and cultural occurrences and the Medieval past.

        "desc": "Digitalization has a profound impact on our society. We can observe changes in different areas. What digital media do, what they look like, and how they relate to each other and to older media is not identical worldwide, but dependent on local practices as well. Transformations are not unequivocal. On the one hand, new genres have emerged, such as streaming channels, providing engaging forms of entertainment and learning, but also provoking vehement discussions about their impact. New possibilities, such as participation in our digital cultures, arise, but also new inequalities, as the access and competencies needed for participation are not evenly distributed, and the platforms that allow for participation also harbor new mechanisms of control and surveillance. The pace and diversity of these developments ask for continuous investigation and reflection. This development has gained a new impetus through the proliferation and popularity of social media, but also the discourses around the Blockchain recently.\n\nThe aim of this course is to investigate the consequences of these developments for society and culture. These consequences have been differently evaluated. The optimistic account stresses the new media\u2019s inherent possibilities for active cultural and social participation and digital citizenship beyond the reach of existing political or commercial institutions. Authors (e.g., Marres, 2017; Fuchs, 2014; Jordan, 2015) acknowledge that participation is not evenly distributed; they also see the democratic possibilities of participation culture, stressing its empowering potential.\n\nAt the same time, these authors share a less optimistic view and approach those changes more critically. There are still huge differences when it comes to access to digital media, which reinforces existing inequalities related to class, race, gender, age, and geographical location. Moreover, among those who have access, there is a participation gap between people with different degrees of mastery of the cultural protocols and practices of the media involved, differentiating between the so-called interacting (those who are able to select their multidirectional circuits of communication) and the interacted (those who are provided with a restricted number of pre-packaged choices) (Castells, 2000 [1996], p. 402).\n\nOthers emphasize that \u2018interaction\u2019 or \u2018participation\u2019 not necessarily means power-sharing or taking control. Rather than being potentially subversive, participatory practices contribute to a more fluid assimilation of users into the online economy and the penetration of everyday private and social life by the logic and power relations of capitalism. The critical angle of participation is compromised: precisely because of the interactivity, diversification, and flexibility of the new media, the networked integration of multiple communication modes enhances the absorption of all forms of cultural expression into the same symbolic environment in which the distinctions between different types of contents and codes are blurred and adapted to a pervasive cultural logic in which entertainment value is predominant. Moreover, previously bottom-up developed platforms are increasingly incorporated by existing media and information companies and provide profitable resources \u2013 in the form of user data \u2013 for online businesses (van Dijck, 2013; Jordan, 2015).\n\nThe recent development of Blockchain technology is ingrained into a libertarian ideology with the goal to give power and control back to the people. The discourse surrounding the Blockchain is again one of liberation and participation. The course will finish with a discussion of ethical questions related to techno-moral changes in our digital cultures. This course is labeled as a humanities course, but the discussion will include literature from qualitative social science research as well.",

Straddling cultural studies, art history, museum studies, media studies, performance studies, literary studies, and science and technology studies, the field of visual culture, at its most expansive, combines theories and methods from across the academy. We will investigate visual cultures from these exciting and challenging (interdisciplinary) perspectives. The course presents visual culture as a ubiquitous facet of modern life that, perhaps more than any other component, shapes and informs our understanding of self, society, and the world. Hence, it demands our careful attention and critical parsing of its workings at all levels of daily life. Our foray into the field will include examining the benefits of this inclusive mode of analysis, for instance, in the range of objects available for study, as well as the drawbacks, particularly in terms of methodological rigor and the overinvestment in ocularcentric forms of knowledge. The student will be invited to scrutinize their disciplinary assumptions, to develop their toolbox of concepts, and to analyze visual objects that are rarely considered inside the university. Starting with an introduction to visual culture, we\u2019ll investigate the terms vision, visuality, and image in conjunction with varying conceptualizations of culture. Each subsequent unit will deal with a \"site\" of visual culture that offers an object of study, a theoretical problem, and an interdisciplinary opportunity. We will study visual cultures from high to low, and examine how these forms are quickly transforming and breaking barriers of category and genre.

        "desc": "\"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\" These words of Albert Einstein are more valid today than ever. The complexities of today's societies and the relationships between them are manifold and not easy to handle. Einstein's plea to look at them in a different way is exactly what this course is about. The course aims to change your perspective on the world, so that you find that \u2018the stuff of the world' can be thought about in new ways that offer opportunities for interventions and passageways for improvement. After all, making a difference requires more than decisiveness: it requires thinking in new ways, thinking 'out of the box'. And that is exactly what this course aims to do by introducing you to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). \n\nIn the field of STS, science and technology are considered as a socio-cultural phenomenon. You will be introduced to STS in two courses. In this course (this one) we will focus on the interrelation between technology and society, while in period 2 (HUM3049: Science, Power, and the Construction of Facts), we take the next step and zoom in on the constitution and application of science and its relations with society. This implies that in both cases, we will pay attention to the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic conditions that impact the development and application of science and technology. \n\nIn this first course, we unpack \u2018technology'. In the standard perspective, technology is largely seen as a process of applied science that simply results from previous scientific advances. In our daily routines, we also tend not to spend much thought on the making of science and technology, commonly do not merit its use serious reflection either. Once things have been made or discovered, our interaction with them is understood to be a straightforward matter. We pick up our mobile phone, make some funny pictures with it, listen to music, twitter some details about what we do and where we are, and chat with our friends. We board an airplane, fly from point A to point B, and then we get off the airplane. Although we are surrounded by the results of scientific endeavor and technologies of various kinds, they have become almost invisible, and we take them for granted. The field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) challenges this perspective on science and technology. \n\nWe live in a technological culture. Technology and science shape society, from the shaping of mobility patterns, gender and sexual identities to the standardization of practices in health care. Mobile phones have changed what it means \u2018to be alone'; organ transplantation has redefined our understanding of life; and AI is changing our ways of being creative. Thus, technologies do not merely assist us in our everyday lives; they are also powerful forces acting to reshape our activities and their meanings. There is, vice versa, a cultural influence on technology too. Therefore, it is important for understanding technology to acknowledge their socio-cultural base. Historical and comparative studies have shown how different socio-cultural circumstances yield very different forms and contents of science and technology. Science and technology are, finally, also cultures themselves.",

Instead, the goal of this course is to analyze the work of young writers who initially appear to engage with genres commonly associated with established literary practices and institutions. Additionally, these young writers not only tackle the significant issues and concerns of our society, such as racial inequality, class and gender disparities, climate change, the rights of migrants and refugees, LGBTQ+ discrimination, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and political violence, but these topics actually form the core of their work. A closer examination reveals that these young writers also challenge the conventional boundaries between genres. For instance, many of them disregard the binary distinction between form and content, which has often been determined along racial lines. Typically, the work of writers of color is more appreciated for its political activism rather than for its experimental approach to form. However, Claudia Rankine stands out as she skillfully combines poetry, essays, and visual art to explore the subject of race through different literary forms. Rankine is an illustrious representative of the hybrid genre known as the lyric essay.

Why did Plato present Socrates and his friends in an elaborate dialogue on love during a fancy dinner instead of just explaining his theories in an orderly written argument? And why can philosophical texts be written quite systematically and be personal (Descartes) as well as in the form of seemingly associative notes and comments (as in Wittgenstein\u2019s famous Philosophical Investigations)? In this course, well-known philosophical texts will be read and analyzed in detail. Students will be confronted directly with the specific, often personal style of a philosopher - that will be completely different from the week before. While the course presents a range of philosophers who considerably differ in time period, background, and philosophical current, what binds them is their careful attention to style, and how their way of presenting their message is intricately bound up with their philosophical outlook. Reading philosophers, that is, the reading of some of their primary texts, is not only a pleasure in itself: most of the more interesting philosophers are also famous stylists. Therefore, it is important to read the original texts instead of always relying on handbooks or (internet) encyclopedia texts to acquaint oneself with the central ideas of these philosophers. Moreover, there is a lot to learn from reading philosophers themselves, to see how they are positioned in the tradition of philosophy and in the contemporary intellectual debate, to determine what interesting problems are, and how one could go about searching for some answers, solutions, or new questions for our time. Reading philosophers themselves also has merit for another reason: it turns out that philosophers use a variety of writing styles and publication media like a scientific treatise, a monograph, an essay, a collection of aphorisms, or even a novel. And last but not least: they provide the best introduction into some of the classical philosophical problems like: What can we know? How should we value? What is justice? Is there something like moral sense? Are we free? How does language work? Who is (not) included or excluded? In this course, we take the time to collectively read and profoundly discuss original texts of Plato, Descartes, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein, and Irigaray.

Which voices, sources, events, and people are remembered, and which are lost to oblivion, is a highly political question. We will explore how aesthetic and artistic narrations of history speak to counter-archives of memory, including the afterlife of slavery, embodied trauma, and legacies of crisis such as with AIDS. Our interest will be in reading along with scholars who have developed methods for grasping deposits of marginalized lived experience through listening to images (Campt), contrapuntal reading (Said), unlearning imperialism (Azoulay), wake work (Sharpe), reading queer ephemera (Mu\u00f1oz), and distilling structures of feeling (Williams) such as feeling brown and down, queer and backward. We will apply these alternative methods for historical analysis to cases of diary writing, poetry, performance, painting, music, photography, and scraps of archival records.\n\nSome of the examples of cultural memory work we will encounter include:\n- Juliette Singh, No Archive can Restore You.

Think of American Transcendentalism, Theosophy, Neo-Hinduism, Neo-Buddhism, Transpersonal Psychology, as well as New Age movements and their offshoots. Students will critically reflect on alternative quests for meaning outside conventional religions and sciences. In doing so, they will learn more about post-Enlightenment responses to the \"age of reason,\" post-colonial encounters between \"eastern\" and \"western\" traditions, and (meta) modern blends of methods and theories from different social and academic domains, which have culminated in a growing \"cultic milieu\" of \"seekers\" across contemporary western cultures. Seekers are people who identify as \"spiritual, but not religious.\" During this course, students engage questions such as: Why have so many seekers in modern western cultures turned away from conventional western religions and sciences? Why are they turning to eastern and western esoteric traditions instead? How are they combining eastern and western methods and theories into new sources of meaning? What combinations have we seen in the recent past, and which ones do we see around today?",

It is frequently rich and complex, filled with uncertainties and difficulties in its encoding, analysis, and structure. The amount of data we have to deal with today can be overwhelming, both for research and in our personal lives. Harnessing the power of large data stores for research in the humanities and social sciences is a core objective of this course. To utilize tens, hundreds, or even thousands of texts, we would not expect you to read as you typically do for your studies (e.g., via close reading, one word, one paragraph, one page after the other) but rather read digitally. Digital 'reading' of texts goes by many names, including data analysis, text analysis, text mining, and data mining. In this class, we are going to focus on the first of these methods, data analysis, an algorithmic-driven method of extracting text from (large) corpora. In this course, we will focus on literary and historical sources, as well as social media. The data analysis tools we will introduce you to will visualize the text, making it easier to see patterns and come to insights, and develop research questions, in minutes or hours, where previously this might have taken days, months, or years. We will explore these methods and practices through distant reading, a recent concept used to theorize the practice of reading algorithmically. This course will take you through a mini big data project to provide you with hands-on experience and understanding of the affordances and limitations of data analysis methods. No background in the methods or programming skills is needed. We will be using easy-to-learn web-based tools and software. Theoretically, we will explore how the representation of text in more visual formats, which are typically removed from its semantic contexts, offers opportunities for both new insights as well as misrepresentation. Concepts to be covered include distant reading, algorithmic visualization, and data feminism. An overarching goal of the course is to help you become more savvy users of digital information: the implications and challenges that methods and technologies pose to conventional research, analysis, and publication in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, including issues such as transparency, authenticity, and bias.",

It seems that one of the main goals of poetry theory in the last centuries has been to give poetry a firm literary profile. When we look at western modern poetry and its reception, this goal has certainly been reached. To a great extent, poetry has become words-on-the-page in this western modern tradition. However, some critics and scholars argue that this traditional mode of poetry, focused on the printed page and dominated by white male poets, is in serious decline. They believe that a new mode of poetry, Spoken Word, led by poets of color and aimed at a younger audience, will inevitably take over, and perhaps it has already done so.\n\nIn the course \"The Future of Literature? HUM2047,\" we will study Spoken Word as a new mode of poetry. Alongside this, we will also study the still vital tradition of 'page poetry' and the often neglected role of women poets in this field. It is important to note that not only white women poets but also women poets of color have written their poetry in this traditional mode, and they continue to do so. Even more importantly, they have often transformed it.\n\nHere are some women poets whom we will read and study in this course: Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Maya Angelou, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, and Louise Gl\u00fcck.

Their ideas are partially the result of the practical turn within philosophy initiated in the 19th century by Karl Marx (1818-1883), S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), and Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914). So, elaborating on their work during the past century, many philosophers took practical issues as the starting point of their philosophy.

In a relatively brief period, we went from hunting and gathering to tilling the soil and domesticating plants and animals. Why and how did we do this? Since the agricultural revolution, our numbers have multiplied beyond comprehension. Societies became increasingly complex and stratified. The industrial revolution lifted everything to a new unprecedented plane. A type of society arose, driven by industrial innovation and run on fossil fuels. We are still living in that kind of society today, so it is interesting to know how it came about. The course will also deal with topics like the role of war, disease, religion, worldviews, and finance in shaping history. Take disease. Their ways of life brought men in contact with all sorts of diseases. Especially after the agricultural revolution, we had to adapt to diseases we caught from our domesticated animals. We still have to do this. Look at present-day threats like bird flu. Living in some form of armed peace with diseases has always been a major characteristic of societies. How did we do this?

Additionally, students will learn the differences between a structuralist and a postclassical approach to narratology. During the second part of the course, the subject of investigation will be narrativity in different media. We will explore how different media construct stories and to what extent these stories are medium-specific. The media that will be studied include the short story, the fixed image and series of images, comics, film, hyperfiction, and digital games. For students with a particular interest in literature, the Handbook of Narrative Analysis (2005) will be most instructive, while Narrative across Media will be most useful to students who are more oriented towards other media. Throughout this course, we will read chapters from both books as well as other literature that addresses the narrativity of media. The final essay must demonstrate that students are able to apply the methods introduced during the course to a case study of their choice. Some examples of possible case studies include the novel House of Leaves, the short story collection Olive Kitteridge, the comic Deadpool and its film adaptation, the graphic novel Persepolis, the film 5x2, and the game L.A.

You will learn to examine the way in which these \u2018crucial differences\u2019 are constituted in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, as well as to analyze the ways in which they function on social, cultural, political, and symbolic levels. The emergence of various social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the women\u2019s movement, the civil rights movement, and gay and lesbian liberation, and their lasting impact on society today, serves as a starting point for the course. We will examine how these diverse movements have shaped and reshaped the form and content of the identity of racial/ethnic minorities, feminists, LGBTQ+ people, and other minoritized groups on individual and collective levels. Special attention will be directed to the notion of intersectionality, which refers to the interaction between multiple categories of difference in cultural, social, and individual practices, and the effects of these interactions in terms of power and inequality. Subsequently, we will take a closer look at the complexity of such multiple differences and inequalities by tracing the entangled workings of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, age, and religion through a variety of topical cases. We will look at the way in which such categories realign in various contexts of crisis and conflict, ranging from the late twentieth-century wars in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to the complex force-fields of (neo-)nationalism, populism, and xenophobia today. We will use a queer theoretical approach to analyze the complex relations between norms of gender and sexuality in the structuring of contemporary performances of identity in a variety of social, cultural, and institutional environments. We will critically examine contemporary constructions of whiteness and the role of race in the construction of national identity. We will direct special attention to the emergence of sexual nationalisms across and beyond Europe today, focusing on the prominent place that women\u2019s sexual liberation and gay rights occupy in contemporary debates about Islam and multicultural citizenship. As these cases indicate, the course draws on a variety of geographical and cultural locations and contexts. Diversity is also exemplified in the interdisciplinarity that characterizes gender and diversity studies as a scholarly field. The texts used in this course draw on theories and methods from disciplines such as philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies, as well as from the fields of feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and queer studies. Through critical inquiry into concrete cases as well as major texts - including modern classics in the field such as Judith Butler\u2019s Gender Trouble and Joan Scott\u2019s The Politics of the Veil - this course dynamically reconceptualizes the intersections between the various \u2018crucial differences\u2019 by examining the multiple ways in which processes of identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality are produced and reproduced in ongoing flows of negotiation and transformation.",

However, the starting point of the course is the notion that literature exists only in the readings given to it: literature has no existence outside these readings. The work of literature is an event or, from the reader's position, an experience, both set in a particular culture that is made up by habits, norms, values, representations, beliefs, expectations, and prejudices. With the recent merging of literature's functions of education and moral improvement in mind (e.g. for the benefit of democracy, see Martha Nussbaum's work), the main challenge of the course is trying to find out in what way the ethical and political demand made by a literary work is to be found in what makes it literature, as an event and as an experience, rather than in properties it shares with other discourses, such as historical writing, biographies, and journalistic work. In other words: what is it that makes acts of literature in society literary acts?",

It focuses on age as an identity marker and is set up in a true interdisciplinary fashion, encompassing perspectives from economy, history, the arts, globalization, and gender studies, amongst others. If you believe aging is far removed from your personal sphere \u2013 think twice and continue reading! Headlines everywhere tell us that ours is a graying world and that population aging will be a defining influence on our twenty-first century, radically affecting public health and national economies. These demographic predictions\u2014the result of the trends of declining mortality and increasing longevity\u2014are typically accompanied by dire warnings of the challenges ahead: unsustainable pension systems which will encumber younger generations, the critical need for more caregivers and more resources to care for the increasing numbers of those who are frail and dependent, concerns about maintaining technological progress and competitive workforces with an aging labor force, etc. Rarely are such numbers presented in terms of the possible benefits that population aging might bring, such as experienced leadership, informal caregiving, and a more flexible labor force less hampered by child care. Also often excluded from these projections is any sense of what life is actually like for the diverse millions of people who grow into old age. How do we know what these numbers will mean for our economies, our social structures, our loved ones, and ourselves? To begin to address that question, we need to understand better what it means to grow old in the twenty-first century and how this meaning may have developed or changed over the course of history or be differently shaped by national and transnational cultures. Also, it requires research into the many images and stories of aging that circulate in popular culture and influence the way we think about older people. This, then, will form the heart of the inquiry we will make in this course. We will explore what aging is and means from different disciplinary, historical, and (trans)national perspectives, examining the concerns raised about aging societies and the causes and consequences of ageism, which is prejudice or discrimination based upon a person\u2019s age. Aging is a topic that we all have a stake in. On one level, this stake is very personal. If we live the long lives we desire, we will all become older, whether or not the label \u201cold\u201d is one we fear or desire. On a larger scale, the concerns of population aging cross every discipline and ageism pervades all parts of our social and personal lives, even when we don\u2019t recognize it. Whatever occupation you pursue, a deeper understanding of aging will have relevance. This course will prepare you to engage critically in the current and future debates about our aging society and to interrogate your hopes and fears for your own aging experiences.

This multidisciplinary course can be divided into two major parts: a historical section dedicated to the \"short twentieth century\" until 1989-91 and a contemporary section that explores the achievements and shortcomings of the past three decades.\n\nThe first half of the course begins by examining East-West relations in Europe on both material and discursive levels. It then delves into the emergence of the nation-state system and the rise and fall of democracy following the First World War. The course also focuses on the simultaneous rise of the Bolshevik regime in the newly formed Soviet Union, as well as its development under Lenin and Stalin. Sessions are dedicated to the origins of Soviet-type regimes in Eastern Europe and the major challenges these regimes faced, such as the Hungarian uprising and the Prague Spring, as well as the reasons behind the unexpected and sudden collapse of these regimes in 1989-91.\n\nThe second half of the course evaluates the political and economic transformation of Eastern Europe since 1989-91. Key topics include questions about democratization and the quality of democracy in the region, as well as the European opening and the associated expectations, hopes, and disappointments. The course also examines the origins and progression of the two major violent conflicts in the region: the 1990s conflict in former Yugoslavia and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Finally, the course concludes with a discussion of the major challenges that Eastern European countries currently face.",

(Mudimbe, Invention, p.9). Course readings are predominantly based on writings that are produced either on the African continent or by African writers and/or scholars. We start out the course with an interrogation into how we imagine the continent from within and outside of Africa. Does the \u201csingle story\u201d narrative, i.e. stereotypical representations that involve images of poverty, starvation and war, influence our imagination as outlined by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie or is our imagination more multilayered? What comes after is a historical journey into how Africans came into contact with Europeans prior to the Atlantic slave trade. Excerpts from John Thornton\u2019s book, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World 1400 \u2013 1800 (2012) will serve as a starting point for this. We then look into African epistemologies of knowledge to explore how African knowledge is constructed and organized. Focusing on Mudimbe\u2019s The Invention of Africa (1988), we explore what he refers to as \u201cAfrican gnosis,\u201d i.e. a term he uses to include African traditional systems of thought into what is generally denoted as African philosophy. We look into the argument in which he states that the colonizing structure has resulted in dichotomizing structures where the traditional is juxtaposed with the modern, the oral with the written, the agrarian with the urban and the subsistence economy with the highly productive economy. This, in turn, has produced marginal societies, cultures, and human beings. This task is followed by Aime\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism (1950), an intense and exemplary text from the Black radical tradition written at the height of decolonization movements in Africa and at a time when Western colonial nations were losing their hold on their colonies. From this, we take a dive into examples of anticolonial resistance via sections from Saidya Hartmann\u2019s study on the transatlantic slave route as well as Frantz Fanon\u2019s reflections on the complexities of resistance by the Algerian population during the Algerian war. Fanon provides us with a brilliant analysis of the doctor-patient relationship and its significance to the anticolonial struggle. This is followed by exploring how movements such as Pan-Africanism and the Black Consciousness movement in South Africa have affected the African experience. Desmond Tutu\u2019s No Future without Forgiveness (1999), a detailed and fascinating report on South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission comes after this exploration. We conclude the course by delving into contemporary political themes such as African feminism, Queer politics, questions of whiteness in Africa, and the politics of \u201cdevelopment.\u201d",

And yet, the economic importance of information, information systems, and thus information management has been growing constantly over the last decades, thanks to the relentless increase in computer performance. We are increasingly dependent on information systems and data to make decisions in a wide range of domains. Sensor and network technology help us to collect and analyze data in real-time, and to speed up decision making in all areas of our society. The possibilities of information and computer science are endless, but they also raise concerns: for instance, about privacy, security, and identity, but also about interpretation and perception of data. All these developments have led to the present-day \"digital enterprise.\" In digital enterprises, the creation, distribution, use, integration, and manipulation of information is a significant economic activity. The digitization of enterprises also has consequences for society. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society. The digital society can be both a threat and an opportunity to enterprises \u2013 this is, for instance, clearly visible in sectors such as retail (traditional retailers vs. Amazon & Co), accommodation (traditional hotel vs. Airbnb), and transportation (traditional taxis vs. Uber). This course offers an overview of the role of digital concepts in enterprises: the digital enterprise. The course provides both a theoretical grounding and a pragmatic approach to applying key concepts. Drawing on ideas, tools, and techniques from such disciplines as economics, sociology, cognitive science, organizational behavior, and computer science, the course shows the digital enterprise from different perspectives: its position in society and the market, but also elements such as governance, information technology, and people. The course serves as an introduction to other Information and Computer Science courses, in which the various topics of the Digital Enterprise will be discussed in more detail.",

This is reflected by the three main themes around which this introductory course is centered. The first theme concerns what can be recognized without doubt as the most frequently occurring mathematical problem in practical applications: how to solve a system of linear equations. For this problem, a complete solution procedure is developed which provides the student with a way to deal with such problems systematically, regardless of the number of equations or the number of unknowns. \n\nThe second theme addresses linear functions and mappings, which can be studied naturally from a geometric point of view. This involves geometric 'primitives' such as points, lines, and planes, and geometric 'actions' such as rotation, reflection, projection, and translation. \n\nOne of the main tools of linear algebra is offered by matrices and vectors, for which a basic theory of matrix-vector computation is developed. This allows one to bring these two themes together in a common, exceptionally fruitful, framework. By introducing the notions of vector spaces, inner products, and orthogonality, a deeper understanding of the scope of these techniques is developed, opening up a large array of rather diverse application areas. \n\nThe third theme arises when the point of view is shifted once more, now from the geometric point of view to the dynamic perspective, where the focus is on the effects of iteration (i.e., the repeated application of a linear mapping). This involves a basic theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which has many applications in various branches of science, as will be discussed. For instance, important applications can be found in problems involving dynamics and stability, and applications to optimization problems found in operations research. \n\nMany examples and exercises shall be provided to clarify the issues and to develop practical computational skills. They also serve to demonstrate practical applications where the results of this course can be successfully employed. Students will obtain the insight that various seemingly different questions can all boil down to the same mathematical problem of solving a system of equations. Students will learn to look at the same problem from different angles and will learn to switch their point of view (from geometric to algebraic and vice versa).",

Molecular genetics is indispensable for understanding the proximate causation of phenomena. It explains how genetic information, encoded in DNA, is transcribed and translated into molecules that are involved in the development of characteristics (phenotypes) of an individual. Evolutionary theory tries to solve problems related to the ultimate causation of phenomena. Why have specific genotypes been selected through selection on phenotypes? Its core discipline is evolutionary genetics. Genetics and evolutionary theory will be discussed in this course. The course starts with the mechanisms that cause evolutionary change: natural selection, inheritance, and gene expression. In order to make these mechanisms understandable for students, this course will deal with the essentials of molecular, Mendelian, and population genetics. It then moves on to the evolution of life cycles, sex, and sexual selection. After discussing kin selection, it uses genomic imprinting to explain genetic conflicts. Game theory will be used to explain the models that treat conflicts. The course will finish with the evolution of life histories, especially senescence. Besides theoretical and mathematical models, the course will treat the applications of these models within the fields of biology, medicine, and psychology. For example, sexual selection will be used to explain the principles of partner selection in human beings (psychology), kin selection will be treated in the context of conflicts between paternal and maternal alleles during pregnancies (medicine), and the evolution of sex will be treated in relation to rates of mutation and recombination (biology).",

Models allow us to approach complex questions systematically, for instance, by predicting weather conditions, the patterns of bird flight formations, or the results of presidential elections. Such questions are present everywhere, and it is through modeling that we can try to find some answers. Modeling helps us to break down what we are studying into variables, understand relations or correlations between them, and even predict the future. The course starts with an introduction to models, followed by several case studies illustrating their usefulness in various contexts. The course fosters a thorough understanding of natural, social, and cultural phenomena by exposing students to models used in academia and everyday thinking. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to apply models to specific situations and examples from their daily life.

The course exposes students to basic mathematical proofs and lets them get a first taste of giving proofs themselves.

A common drive of human activity is to make things better, to enhance performance, and to carry out the best possible actions in given situations. Often the essentials of a situation can be captured by a mathematical description (a model, with or without constraints) and the value of a proposed action by a function (an optimization criterion). Then the goal becomes to optimize the criterion for the given model under the associated constra ints (if any). Depending on the nature of the model, the constraints, and the optimization function, many different mathematical techniques are available to characterize and compute optima. In this course we address the most important areas in optimization and we study the most common techniques. First, we consider the optimization of unconstrained continuous functions in several variables. Some notions we will come across are: partial derivatives; the gradient and the Hessian; stationary points; minima, m axima and saddle points; local and global optima. Techniques to compute optima range from analytical and algebraic techniques (i.e., solving systems of equations) to iterative and approximate numerical techniques (e.g., gradient methods and hill climbing, Newton and quasi -Newton methods, and several others). We will focus on a selection of these. An important class of functions to consider is that of least squares criteria. We will consider both linear and nonlinear least squares problems and suitable itera tive techniques to solve them. Linear least squares problems are often encountered in the context of fitting a model to measurement data. They also allow one to rephrase the problem of solving a nonlinear system of equations as an optimization problem, whi le the converse is possible too. Second, we address optimization problems subject to a given set of constraints. A well -known such class consists of linear optimization functions subject to linear equality or inequality constraints: the class of linear programs. The problem of fitting a linear model to measurement data using the criterion of least absolute deviations, can be reformulated as a linear program. Several methods are available to solve such problems, including active set methods and the simple x algorithm, but also interior point methods and primal -dual methods. We discuss the Kuhn -Tucker conditions for optimality. For the optimization of nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints we address the Lagrange multiplier method.  To demonstrate the various optimization problems and solution techniques, we will provide many examples and exercises. To demonstrate the wide range of applicability, these are taken from different fields of science and engineering. To become acquainted with optimization techniques, one computer class is organized in which the basics of the software package Matlab are presented. Intended Learning Outcomes \uf0b7 To become familiar with the basic concepts and methods of optimization. \uf0b7 To understand how techniques from calculus and linear algebra are useful for optimization. \uf0b7 To become familiar with a diversity of optimization problems and solution techniques. \uf0b7 To be able to cast certain real -world problems into the form of optimization problems. \uf0b7 To be able to solve certai n optimization problems with software (Matlab) .

The problem of fitting a linear model to measurement data using the criterion of least absolute deviations can be reformulated as a linear program. Several methods are available to solve such problems, including active set methods and the simple x algorithm, as well as interior point methods and primal-dual methods. We discuss the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for optimality. For the optimization of nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints, we address the Lagrange multiplier method.\n\nTo demonstrate the various optimization problems and solution techniques, we will provide many examples and exercises. These examples and exercises are taken from different fields of science and engineering to demonstrate the wide range of applicability. To become acquainted with optimization techniques, one computer class is organized in which the basics of the software package Matlab are presented.",

Prior knowledge of basic (bio)chemical concepts is required, such as the structure and function of macromolecules, common forms of chemical reactions, basic cell structure, and the metabolism of macromolecules. The course is centered around a practical case study in which students, in groups, develop a recommendation regarding nutrition and exercise for a patient, client, or organization. As an advanced-level course with students from diverse backgrounds, additional recommendations on how to motivate the client to meet the recommendations can also be provided. \n\nThe first part of the course focuses on providing a theoretical framework on the basics of exercise biochemistry and physiology. Through tutorial groups, students discuss topics such as the physiology of muscles, the metabolism of macronutrients, the hormonal regulation of metabolism, and the role of micronutrients in exercise and fatigue. The theoretical framework is directly related to the case study, allowing students to apply their knowledge. \n\nThe course builds upon knowledge acquired in basic and intermediate courses, such as biochemistry, human physiology, and cell biology. Students are also encouraged to draw upon relevant knowledge from other courses. This course serves as a culmination, where relevant knowledge from previous courses is combined and applied.\n\nIn the second part of the course, students delve deeper into the case study and fill in any gaps in their understanding. This may involve conducting additional literature research or seeking guidance from professionals who regularly deal with similar cases. Ample class time is provided to discuss group work and provide feedback to fellow groups. Students also have the opportunity to present their ideas, findings, and remaining questions, as well as receive feedback on their approach to the case study.

Theoretical application of mathematical and computer science-based models were used to explain how neurons function. As a result, additional disciplines such as physics, mathematics, bioengineering, and computer science became important parts of this research field. Consequently, an effective research project in cognitive neuroscience requires interdisciplinary cooperation. Each scientific discipline contributes its respective genuine theories, models, techniques, and tools for the mutual investigation of the neuronal principles of perception, attention, and cognition. However, the question remains: can we really watch the brain at work? Are there ways to identify where and when activation in the brain is necessary to perform a specific mental process?

The increase in global wealth that neoliberal market strategies have brought is not distributed evenly across the globe. Since wealth and health are intrinsically related, the aforementioned flows create new health inequalities. Indeed, we have seen that in the past decades, in which globalization has come to full fruition, disease patterns have shifted and disease manifestations have changed. For instance, migration of people entails the spread of epigenetic predispositions to disease. Climate change causes microorganisms or vectors to spread beyond their usual habitat, facilitating the onset of diseases in regions where diseases were not endemic before. Flows of technology change local settings, with consequences for people\u2019s health. As technological advances are not available to all, the divide between those who have access and those who do not deepens.\n\nMigrating diseases or causes of diseases challenge our understanding of disease. For instance, some familial diseases such as sickle cell disease that have spread through migration are often constructed and classified as \"racial\" diseases, whereas evidence shows in this case it is rather the gene-environment interaction that underlies disease manifestation. Most diseases are the result of complex interactions between genetic, biological, behavioral, social, political, economic, and cultural factors, at the intersection of which individual or population health finds itself.\n\nExamining flows of diseases, people, goods, knowledge, and technology induced by processes of globalization can deepen our understanding of the complexity of health and disease. In this course, these flows will be studied in depth, bringing insights into (epi)genetic disease distributions as well as the spread of information and technology, and migration, all of which affect health and disease.

We all want to know what makes us and other people tick! However, our common sense understanding of how people think, feel, and act is often misguided. The self-referential nature of psychology has caused some people to believe that psychology is not a science at all! This course will show you that psychology is a science and encompasses the collaborative efforts of scientists from many different disciplines. Psychology is the study of behavior and mental processes, and as psychologists, we aim to describe, understand, predict, and sometimes change behavior. Psychologists study human behavior and mental life from different perspectives (i.e., biological, individual, and social) and at different levels of analysis (from genes and the brain up to the social and cultural level). We will consider what these different approaches have to offer in our quest for an understanding of the human mind, the brain, and behavior. Along the way, scientific methods of psychological research will be introduced by addressing some of the main questions that drive contemporary psychology: How do we experience fear or happiness? How do we (think we) see the world around us? How do we learn, remember, and forget things? Where should we draw the line between normal and abnormal behavior? How social are humans? When do people harm or help others?",

        "desc": "This course aims to introduce students to the general content of modern law and the discipline of legal reasoning. These two concepts are interconnected. It is impossible to fully comprehend law without considering the specific perspectives of lawyers, judges, and other experts within the legal system. By the end of the course, students should be able to understand the nature of law and its distinctions from, as well as similarities to, morality. They should also be able to identify the main branches of law and their fundamental institutions, recognize and differentiate the core values underlying these branches, and grasp the essence of legal reasoning and its application to legal issues.\n\nMany people assume that studying law involves solely the laws of a particular jurisdiction. For example, a Dutch lawyer would study Dutch law, while a German lawyer would focus on German law, with little overlap between these two professions other than their chosen field. However, this perception is misleading. Despite each country establishing its own legal system, the diversity in law is much less significant than one would think. This course emphasizes the idea that law naturally emerges as a solution to various social problems, and thus, similar responses emerge across different societies facing similar problems. While there may be differences in the specifics, concepts such as contracts, property, inheritance, marriage, constitutions, and crimes exist in almost all modern societies. Instead of focusing on specific sets of rules, such as the Dutch Civil Code or the French Criminal Code, this course explores these widely shared problems and institutional responses.\n\nRegarding legal reasoning, students will be challenged to develop a taxonomy that will aid in their understanding of how law can be used as a tool to address regulatory and redistributive purposes. Furthermore, the course will include a \"workshop\" where students will analyze a high-profile judgment and identify the logical steps taken by a court to justify its decision.",

The course will start with a simple examination of the meaning of the word \"politics.\" How much of politics is really about solving distribution problems? In other words, a limited amount of resources in society must be distributed in some equitable manner. After this initial discussion, the course will move to consider the central themes of Macro politics, with particular emphasis on the classification of political systems, political ideology, and political authority. Themes in Micro politics are addressed in the second half of the course. Micro politics refers to the study of how individuals \"fit\" into their political system. Micro political topics will include political socialization, political groups, elections, voting, political parties, party systems, and political leadership. The course ends with a look at system performance and how to bring about change in political systems when performance is wanting. To help students understand and relate to the political realm in which they exist, each student is required to embark on an individual research paper about their country of origin.

The first part of the course discusses several mainstream International Relations (IR) theories and issues, including neoliberalism, neorealism, and debates about the liberal world system. Moreover, the problematics of soft versus hard power, absolute versus relative gain, cooperating versus cheating, war versus peace will be discussed.

We will immediately start studying contemporary IR. \n\nThe second part of the course covers less mainstream approaches, some 'new' theories, and some neglected issues about the 'other' side of world politics. In this part, normative and ideational structures, environmental issues, problems of the developing world, gendered-biases, economic inequalities, the construction of partial knowledge, the legitimization of power politics, the representation of images, establishment of stereotypes, and the reproduction of hegemony will be studied critically. Moreover, new IR approaches like Queer theory and Asian IR approaches will be discussed. In this part, we aim at asking important questions and try to find reflective answers about the role of power and hegemony, how to make IR more green, how to decolonialize knowledge about the world, and how to make IR and politics more gender-sensitive. It is important that students become aware of the theoretical richness of the discipline, and that there is not a single 'right' way to answer questions about what is happening around us in the world.

This is illustrated by the recent financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as emerging topics such as climate change and corporate social responsibility, which are increasingly affecting corporate decision making. The field of corporate finance deals with the financing and investment decisions made by company management in order to maximize shareholder wealth and address the preferences of other stakeholders. \n\nThis course provides a broad overview of important issues in corporate finance, drawing on insights from economics and sustainable finance. On the economic side, corporate finance focuses on maximizing shareholder wealth. Managers strive to secure the highest possible return while accepting the least amount of risk. For example, a company may choose to finance itself by borrowing money from banks, issuing bonds, or issuing equity on the stock market. These decisions influence the expected return and risk of the company.\n\nTraditional economics assumes that managers and investors are rational, self-interested individuals. However, there is a significant body of evidence from social psychology and behavioral economics that suggests people often act irrationally and consider the social impact of their decisions. This course also explores how decision-making biases affect managers and investors in their financial choices, as well as how the social preferences of shareholders and stakeholders impact corporate social responsibility.\n\nInvestors in both equity and debt claims of companies have diverse social preferences. Increasingly, large institutional asset owners, such as public pension funds, are pressuring companies' management to improve governance quality, environmental performance, and social performance in their investments.",

In this course, we will discuss various perspectives in economics such as Neoclassical, Austrian, Marxism, Post Keynesian, (New) Institutionalism, and Feminist Economics. We will focus on these perspectives within the field of economics as a scientific discipline and on how these perspectives differ in their views on inequality.\n\nAccording to some scholars, inequality is a natural phenomenon in a capitalist market economy. It is a fair reward for higher education and training. Some other scholars disagree with this view. They observe that the sharpest inequality stems from other sources than education, and it is not justified by individual merits alone. Further, they emphasize that inequality in itself has detrimental effects on societies and therefore it should be prevented as much as possible. Finally, some economists see inequality as the result of economic growth and therefore conclude that increases in societal wealth cannot be attained without inequality.\n\nIn this course, we will first discuss the main elements within each school of thought, how they emerged, and how they differ from each other. Secondly, we will accompany these discussions with their views and interpretations of inequality. We will discuss various perspectives in which inequality can be regarded, such as the distribution of income amongst capitalists versus workers, income inequality between various groups in society, and the difference between inequality in income versus inequality in wealth. How can we explain differences in society and are these differences persistent?\n\nThirdly, and much related to the previous points, is the role of public policy (or the government). Should, and if so how, the government have an active role in redistributing income? Fourthly, we will also touch upon different measures of inequality and how they can be interpreted. All of this will be discussed in tutorial meetings and students will work on (group) papers. We will present and discuss these papers for which we will also include peer feedback.",

The term \"information good\" is broad and encompasses anything that can be digitized, such as books, databases, music, and more. Consequently, trading often occurs over the Internet. Information goods have distinct characteristics, such as a cost structure with high fixed costs but low marginal costs. Making a copy of digital content has virtually no cost. We delve into various topics including pricing, network effects, and lock-in. A particular emphasis will be placed on \"platforms\" like Apple's App Store, Google Search Engine, and Netflix, which often play key roles in information goods markets. \n\nAt the beginning, we introduce concepts from pricing and game theory, building upon the content covered in SSC1027 Principles of Economics. These concepts prove valuable as markets for information goods are often competitive but not perfectly so. As a result, firms can experiment with pricing and selling strategies, while also considering how potential competitors will react. The economics of uncertainty and information explores the significance of information in the decisions and interactions of individuals, the design of contracts, and the functioning of markets. In many situations, individuals lack pertinent information before making decisions. For instance, sellers do not know their customers' willingness to pay, and investors are unaware of the most profitable investment opportunities. Information is frequently not just incomplete, but also unevenly distributed among the involved parties, resulting in \"adverse selection\" and \"moral hazard\" scenarios. Examples include job applications, where the applicant possesses more knowledge about their abilities than the employer, and insurance contracts, where the insurance company cannot observe the insured's efforts to prevent damages. A crucial observation is that the asymmetrical distribution of information often leads to economic inefficiency.",

Accounting is usually seen as the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating financial information about a company to interested users, allowing them to make decisions based on this information. These users can be internal (managers, employees) or external (shareholders, banks, investors). By providing financial information to external users, they can make decisions regarding the firm, such as investing in it or lending money to it. This information also allows investors to predict the future of the company and determine its value. In short, this information allows capital markets to function and provides a healthy economic environment for investment. The communication of financial information is guided by accounting standards, which dictate how it should be recorded and presented to interested parties. This course will follow the International Financial Reporting Standards as the framework for recording and communicating financial information. \n\nHowever, despite these accounting standards, managers still have the ability to present information in a certain way, as they have an informational advantage over external users. They may use this advantage to hide certain information or present a more favorable financial picture of the firm. This can have a negative effect on the functioning of capital markets. Therefore, this course will also cover the topics of corporate governance and auditing. These fields aim to put regulations and systems in place to prevent bias in financial statements and detect any intentional or unintentional misstatements. \n\nGiven the importance of accounting in economic markets, an introduction to this field is beneficial for all students, regardless of their career aspirations. All businesses, whether small or large, will need to communicate information to external users. They will also need to have systems in place to provide assurance that this information is accurate.

How are memories formed and maintained in our mind and brain? Do we have multiple memory systems, or just one memory mechanism from which the richness of memory is derived? What happens if our memory fails us, when we forget or when we remember falsely? This course investigates the behavioral (conditioning), cognitive (information processing), and neurobiological mechanisms of both declarative and non-declarative memory. You will study how some memories are produced automatically by your brain, such as in an operant conditioning paradigm. We will also discuss a number of cognitive models explaining how your explicit experiences are stored in memory. Furthermore, we will discuss synaptic and molecular mechanisms of memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and retrieval, and the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that may strengthen or weaken an existing memory. Finally, we will examine how this knowledge about learning and memory can be transferred to an educational setting such as PBL at Maastricht. These research topics rely on many decades of cognitive and neuroscientific research that has been awarded with Nobel prizes several times (in 2000 to Prof. Kandel for synaptic plasticity and in 2014 to Profs.

The second part of the course will examine several legal processes in detail, using the tools that were developed in the first half of the course.

First of all, this course will provide insight into the meaning of health and public health, how (public) health can be conceptualized, how (public) health can be measured according to indicators, and which determinants influence (public) health. Additionally, it will cover the (future) challenges we face or will be facing in the area of (public) health. \n\nSecondly, students will become familiar with the key concepts of public policymaking. The course will specifically address the policy cycle, which includes problem recognition and definition, agenda building, policy formation, policy implementation, policy evaluation, and feedback. It will also introduce the analytical guideline for health policy analysis, illustrating the interaction between the policy actors or stakeholders, the policy context, and the policy process. \n\nFinally, students will learn to combine the knowledge gained under the first and second objectives. They will understand the implications of public health issues for public health policymaking. This includes studying how public health policymaking works in reality under crisis circumstances, such as infectious disease outbreaks. It also explores how public health policymaking works in reality under non-acute circumstances, where a shift in responsibility can be seen from government (central steering) to governance (decentral steering). \n\nSpecial attention will be paid to health inequalities in public health, the role of genomics in public health, and the importance of economic evaluation in public policymaking, which raises ethical and solidarity issues. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach and includes contributions from political science, public health, medical sociology, health economics, health ethics, and public health genomics.",

Entrepreneurs may start-up companies that challenge (and often replace) incumbents. In the process, they create new jobs and apply competitive pressure on established firms. Entrepreneurs supposedly have an important direct and indirect effect on driving innovation. Despite the heroic image of successful entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship is much more about failure than about success. What motivates entrepreneurial types to venture off on a path that will often result in failure? In this course, you will study factors that drive entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial process. We will focus on new venture gestation: the initial stages of the process that may result in a new company emerging. Throughout the course, you will explore how entrepreneurs not only rely on generic business management principles, but also how they cope with the uncertainty, risk, scarcity of time, capital, and other resources that are inherent to all entrepreneurial venturing. Perhaps you will conclude that many entrepreneurs are, in fact, not really good managers (good entrepreneurs will compensate for this by hiring better managers). We start the course by exploring the process dynamics of entrepreneurial activity. We will then explore the origins of entrepreneurial opportunity, review how entrepreneurs screen and develop the opportunities that they discover, and you will unravel how entrepreneurs seek to appropriate the returns from their enterprising behaviour and benefit from or contribute to entrepreneurial networks and ecosystems. This is not a \u201chow-to\u201d course; instead, the course will introduce you to relevant scholarly insights that provide (future) entrepreneurs with an evidence base for entrepreneurial action.

Numbers will bow to your understanding; quantitative reports in journals and the media will be no match for your critical eye. In Statistics I, you will take your first steps on the path towards mastery of statistics. This course takes a classical approach to statistics and quantitative research methods for social and life sciences. It starts with descriptive statistics (getting the hang of a sample) and continues with inferential statistics (generalizing sample results to entire populations). But don't mistake \"classical\" for \"traditional\". Statistics deserves to be colorful and exciting, so prepare yourself for a course full of relatable and relevant stories. Our goal is to make you fall in love with a field that you never knew you liked. By the end, you will know how to visualize and summarize variables, test null hypotheses, construct confidence intervals, and capture associations between categorical as well as quantitative types of data. And you will be excited that you now understand everything the previous sentence said. Learning statistics is all about interacting with it. Throughout the six course modules, you will solve a myriad of assignments that will help you build \u2013 and trust \u2013 a quantitative intuition.

As a result, human thought was not always the topic of psychology, especially during the rise of radical behaviorism in the early 20th century. Anything referring to mental processes was not to be used in explanations of human behavior. However, with the invention of computers that could mimic behavior, along with the failure of behaviorism to account for even the simplest human behavior, the focus on the mind returned to psychology. And it returned with a vengeance. During the 1960s and 1970s, information processing theory became the leading paradigm in psychology and remains a major influence to this day, especially in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience. Information processing theory utilizes concepts of computation and representation and deals with how people receive, store, integrate, retrieve, and use information. The present course is concerned with theoretical and empirical perspectives on human cognition, perception, and the experimental methods used to study cognition and perception. Eleven basic topics of cognitive science/psychology are discussed using a Problem Based Learning format. The first part of the course covers basic concepts in cognitive science, while the second part applies those concepts to major topics in psychology. Some of the topics studied in the course include the history of the study of the human mind as an information processing machine, computation, representation, top-down and bottom-up processing, semantic networks and spreading of activation, imagination, attention, language, and emotion.",

You will learn about different theoretical conceptualizations and measurement approaches to personality and intelligence. Based on the purpose of the assessment, different methods may prove more or less valuable. You will also discover different explanations for why people differ in their personalities and their levels of intelligence.

Activists from the right and the left challenged existing orders and increased societal strife. Political polarisation has eroded social cohesion and pitted people against one another. And then, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. BLM, #MeToo, alt-right movements, mass shootings, popular uprisings, police violence, fierce debates about climate change and gender equality and LGBTQ-rights and rising inequalities: they all relate to social order in one way or another. In tempestuous times, questions about social order become important. What makes society work? What unites us? What divides us?\n\nIn \"Theories of Social Order,\" we use a sociological perspective to study the different types of glue that hold societies together. For sociologists, the root of the problem of social order lies in the sometimes conflicting interests of individuals and those of groups (and societies). Whenever individual interest conflicts with group interest, social order is at risk. A solution to the problem requires the reconciliation of individual and collective interests, but how to do that is not a given. Theorists have provided several answers to this vexing question.\n\nWe consider five mechanisms that produce social order: individuals, hierarchies, markets, groups, and networks. Foundational texts by classic sociologists are combined with contemporary extensions and empirical applications on contemporary problems of social order, i.e. (1) political polarisation in the US and Europe, and (2) the corona pandemic. The editorial introductions by Hechter & Horne provide the background for each of these texts and link them to the central problem. The strengths and weaknesses of the various theories are discussed, by relating them to contemporary events whenever feasible. We also explore how to test theories against evidence. In this way, students will improve their understanding of the social world and will learn to apply the analytical tools to real-life phenomena.",

In this course, we will evaluate the global reach and local impacts of our current financial system, including the financialization of more and more aspects of our everyday lives like housing, education, work, medical care, retirement, and even art. From a variety of perspectives, we will learn about the histories, practices, and theories behind the crises-struck but seemingly inevitable rise of finance into the 21st century. The way we know about money and finance today is changing. In fact, a global economic crisis has become a crisis of orthodox Economics. But, what exactly is a crisis, and who decides?\n\nIn November 2008, only weeks after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Queen Elizabeth inaugurated a new building at the London School of Economics. Referring to \"the financial crisis\", she asked the professors, \"Why did nobody notice it?\" In a written reply, the scholars explained that the reason \"was principally a failure of the collective imagination of many bright people, both in this country and internationally, to understand the risks to the system as a whole.\" This course introduces attempts to re-imagine our knowledge of money and finance by many \"other\" bright people, among which anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, philosophers, artists, and even some economists.\n\nWe will discuss contested notions of public and private ownership, debt and investment, speculation, risk and uncertainty, as well as regulation and taxation. Instead of dealing with business cases, the course explores different fields of finance ethnographically, providing glimpses of the worlds of central banking, corporate and shadow banking, private wealth management, and new digital financial technologies also known as \"fintech\". Based on these examples, we will consider the meanings of financial vocabularies (e.g. those of collateral and leverage), as well as the legal codes of financial derivatives (such as credit default swaps).\n\nWe will analyze capitalist ethics of growth and financial profitability, as well as the ideals and rhetoric of trust and transparency that often clash with opaque realities of corruption and fraud. Projecting the dominant temporalities and politics of finance against an urgent backdrop of global humanitarian and ecological crises, we will learn that price is not to be equated with value(s). But how do the values of finance affect us today, and what are the prices we are willing to pay for the failures of its imagined futures?",

The look at Latin American history will also focus on the process of organizing the newly independent states during the 19th century and the challenges associated with building a national identity. The tasks will then focus on more recent events such as the military regimes and state violence of the second half of the 20th century, the struggles for constructing a public memory, the problem of narcotraffic, the US-Latin American relations, and the presence and struggles of Latinos in the US. The course will finish with tasks around the topics of Gender, Race, and Ethnicity, finalizing with a discussion of what alternatives to mainstream development paradigms Latin America has to offer. Transversal topics will be social inequality, marginalized groups' social struggles, and the alternative politics of women, blacks, and indigenous social movements.",

The Middle East has always been a subject of political and academic debates, thanks to its controversial history, its demography, and its major actors. It is also a topic of economic debates due to its abundant natural resources, and security debates due to the wars and conflicts that have affected the global structure as a whole.\n\nThe Middle East is infamous for hosting powerful, undemocratic, and repressive political regimes, while at the same time, it is home to extremely vibrant civil societies, record-breaking numbers of bloggers, and online youth activism. It has been an arena where great powers have tried to extend their political, ideological, and economic ambitions and have intervened almost regularly. \n\nFor some, the Middle East is a common and generic name for societies that share the same religion, language, history, and culture. However, for more careful observers, it is an extremely diverse area where various groups speak different languages and practice distinct religions that have persisted for centuries. For critical minds, the Middle East is not an objective and neutral space, but a politically constructed concept that is reproduced through certain discourses, representations, and practices.\n\nIn any case, the Middle East has always been a birthplace or meeting place for a complex combination of significant political, social, cultural, religious, ideational, and economic actors, issues, and movements. The purpose of this course is to shed light on this incredibly interesting and debated region and discuss its historical, economic, social, and, most importantly, political realities. \n\nThis course will investigate both the past and the present of the region. It will begin by introducing the concept of the Middle East, not only as a geographical place but also as a cultural, contextual, discursive, and political concept. Then, the course will delve into the history of the region and its ongoing effects on current developments. In this context, major events, ideas, issues, both external and internal actors, and political movements that have shaped the Middle East will be introduced.\n\nIn the remaining time, specific and contemporary issues such as interventions in the 21st century, the Arab Spring, the Syrian civil war, and rising rivalries between regional powers will be discussed and critically analyzed.",

Questions like these are at the core of the field of public economics. \n\nPublic economics (or public finance) is the study of the role of government in the economy. It is all about the formulation, execution, and effects of government policy. \n\nStudying public economics involves answering the following four broad questions: \n\n1. When should the government intervene in the economy? \n2. How might the government intervene? \n3. What is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes? \n4. Why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? \n\nWe will return to these questions throughout the entire course. In each tutorial, we will discuss one specific policy challenge or societal problem \u2014just like those mentioned in the very beginning. \n\nDuring the tutorials, we will start with the first question and ask whether there is a justification for government intervention. Afterwards, we will turn to questions two and three and discuss potential policy responses and their effects. \n\nThe aim of the tutorials is to learn about the way economists think about these challenges and how to incorporate them into economic models. \n\nThe government differs from other organizations because it can use legal instruments to enact policies. It may also have different goals than other actors in the economy. However, as economists, we often call for free markets and argue in favor of free exchange among firms and individuals, since the price mechanism is an efficient allocation mechanism for scarce resources. So why even have a government? \n\nMarket Failures: One reason is just that the real world is way nastier than our cute theoretical models. In the real world, we regularly see that markets fail. Reasons can be, for example, that private actors do not internalize all their costs, that buyers and sellers have asymmetric information, the tragedy of the commons, or the presence of monopolies. We will discuss several such cases in Part II of the course. \n\nFairness: Even if markets worked perfectly fine, we may conclude that efficiency alone is not a sufficient criterion. In Part III of the course, we will focus on fairness issues and discuss aspects of inequality, poverty, welfare, and redistribution. \n\nThis course provides basic knowledge of public policy.

        "desc": "This course provides students with an academic and practical approach to the study of public policy and, more specifically, the professional practice of policy analysis and evaluation. Public policies can be defined as \"a course of government action or inaction in response to public problems\" such as limited access to healthcare or education, environmental degradation, workplace safety concerns, corruption, traffic congestion, or air pollution (Kraft and Furlong 2010:5). These problems can range from simple to complex and can occur at various levels, from local to global. They often reflect conflicts over causes, solutions, problem definitions, and fundamental human values. Decision-makers responsible for making final decisions on these issues need to be informed by evidence-based policy analysis and evaluation. It is the task of the policy analyst/evaluator to provide sound evidence, analysis, and advice. \n\nTo prepare students for these tasks, this course aims to develop critical thinking and understanding of public policy and alternative courses of action. Students will deliberate and analyze key concepts, models, approaches, and methods of policy analysis and evaluation, as well as practice basic skills. In the first week of the course, students will explore the nature of policy analysis and evaluation, considering the role of power, politics, institutions, and actors in the policy-making process. The second week will focus on problem structuring, while in the third week, students will learn how to work with evaluative criteria and choose policy options to formulate policy advice. The knowledge gained in these three weeks will be applied as students work in small groups to prepare and present a policy advice based on a real-life country case. Prior to the midterm exam, students will be introduced to two commonly used methods of policy analysis and evaluation: cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. The midterm exam will consist of an individually written policy memorandum and a team role play based on that memorandum. \n\nAfter the midterm, the course will shift focus from acquiring basic knowledge to exploring policy evaluation approaches in greater depth. Students will learn about plan, process, and outcome evaluations based on the realist or theory-based evaluation approach. They will have the opportunity to conduct and present a plan and/or process evaluation in small groups, using another real-life case. Finally, the course will explore ethical and accountability aspects of policy analysis and evaluation, as well as the role of the public in the process. \n\nThroughout the course, students will engage with six cases, some of which will span multiple tutorials, and attend lectures delivered by both academic and professional practitioners who will share their knowledge and experiences. In addition to studying academic and policy literature, students will also engage in hands-on work with evaluation cases.

Statistics I has shown you that statistics need not be intimidating; that many can master it \u2013 and enjoy doing so. With the foundations of inferential statistics under your belt (confidence intervals, p-values, and the like), as well as an arsenal of different tests, things are about to get bigger and better. This course will prepare you to tackle even more questions in the social and life sciences that call for quantitative answers. The key distinction, which sounds far less exciting than it really is, is that it\u2019s time for \u2018models with more variables\u2019. After refreshing the different t-tests (one sample, independent and paired), we shall discuss one- and two-way ANOVA. After that, two weeks will be devoted to regression analysis. Simple regression will come to pass again, but we will soon expand it with dummy variables and then to multiple regression (with more than one independent variable). The last part of the course will introduce you to repeated measures ANOVA (RANOVA for short), which remains a staple in research in the social sciences. But don\u2019t mistake all these technical terms for a series of bone-dry discussions. Statistics deserves to be colorful and exciting, so prepare yourself for a course full of relatable and relevant stories. If Statistics I did not yet make you fall in love with a field you never knew you liked, our mission is to finally steal your heart away this time. Just like before, learning statistics is all about interacting with it. Throughout the six course modules, you will solve a myriad of assignments that will help you grow \u2013 and trust \u2013 your quantitative intuition. You will learn how you can make statistical software do your bidding and apply your understanding of mathematical models to make sense of the world around you\u2026 more than ever.

The course therefore firstly addresses the concept of the \u2018atrocity triangle\u2019 and it looks into the relationship between the three actors (the perpetrator, the victim, and the bystander) involved in the triangle. Subsequently, an integrated criminological model will be introduced, which sets out the relevant etiological elements that will be addressed in greater detail in the second part of the course. \n\nThe second part of the course, which focuses on the perpetrators, will start with the forms, functions, and effects of (political) violence and the concept of torture in particular. The analysis continues on the macro level and addresses the role of policy and ideology. Subsequent analysis focuses on the meso level, and the role of military organizations and other institutions is discussed. In this context, attention is paid to the influence of military training, and we will discuss how with the help of a bureaucratic system, genocide can be planned, organized, and carried out. The discussion will thus address several compulsive and determinative features of the environment surrounding perpetrators of gross human rights violations. Furthermore, we will discuss several experiments (Milgram, Ash, Stanford, etc.) on obedience, institutional roles, and conformity. We will also address other social-psychological mechanisms which are helpful in understanding how and why people are able to participate in the perpetration of gross human rights violations. Lastly, the important role that language and discourse play in conflict and international crime is highlighted. \n\nThe third part of the course will focus on the bystander. We will start the discussion on the role of the bystander by looking into the phenomenon of the \u2018the bystander effect\u2019 in order to address the question of why bystanders fail to act. Secondly, the role of bystanders in international politics at the macro-level of both states and international organizations in the field of human rights will be discussed. We will give special attention to the role of the UN Security Council when it was confronted with gross human rights violations. Lastly, in addition to perpetrators and bystanders (collaborators), certain actors in the same situations did not perpetrate or passively stand by, instead, they took affirmative action and came to the help of those in need. We will therefore look more closely into the phenomenon of rescuing in order to find out what turns actors into rescuers. \n\nThe fourth and last part of the course will take a more victimological perspective, which focuses on the position of the victim. Who are the victims and why are they victimized? What is the relationship between these victims and their perpetrators, and what are the consequences of this relationship? In this context, specific attention will be paid to gender-selective violence. More particularly, the phenomena of rape as a \u2018weapon of war\u2019 and gendercide (gender-selective mass killings) will be discussed. Also, the complex case of child soldiers will be addressed as they are victims and perpetrators at the same time. \n\nSeveral lectures will be held during this course. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice. During the lectures, various guest speakers will address the subject matter from the practitioner\u2019s perspective. In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post-discussion. We hope that, through these documentaries, the subject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract. \n\nCase studies play an important role throughout the course, and we will therefore pay attention to a wide variety of cases, including The Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armenia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.). Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide, and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well. Here one could think of the following cases: Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, East Timor, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Central African Republic, etc. Not to forget the torture practices of the U.S. \n\nThe insights gathered throughout this course have policy implications and inform us how we could react to gross human rights violations once they have occurred. These policy implications are addressed in greater detail during another UCM course titled \"The aftermath of atrocity: A course on transitional justice and post-conflict reconstruction\" (SSC 3052), which will be taught during the spring semester in period 5.",

This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the history, process, and sources of American foreign policy so that opinions can be formed on a solid foundation. The course is divided into four sections. \n\nThe first section will focus on foreign policy analysis as a subfield within International Relations. It will provide an overview of various analytical perspectives on U.S. foreign policy and emphasize the importance of studying American foreign policy in today's world. \n\nSection two will delve into the history of U.S. foreign policy, covering significant events such as the Founding of the United States, World War I, the interwar years, World War II, the rise of a Superpower, the Cold War, the Post-Cold War era, September 11th, and recent world events including the Iraq War, the Global War on Terror, and the presidency of Donald J. Trump. \n\nPart three will examine the politics and policy-making process involved in American foreign policy. This section will discuss the various institutions that play a role in the policy-making process, including the President, bureaucratic agencies like the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the CIA, as well as Congress and the Courts. It will also consider the influence of the American public in shaping U.S. foreign policy. \n\nThe final part of the course will explore the instruments used to implement American foreign policy. It will cover diplomatic instruments, both hidden and open, economic instruments, and military instruments. The course will conclude with a task that explores the future of American foreign policy.",

At the end of the day, theory serves as a structured form of communication through which people try to make sense of their social realities. This quote by Charles Lemert emphasizes the significance of theory in understanding the world we live in.\n\nThis course serves as the second part of a series that aims to explore the historical development of social theory. The first part of the series, known as Classical Social Theory, focuses on social theories up until the 1930s. In contrast, this specific course will delve into social theories that have emerged between the 1960s and the year 2000. During this period, there have been significant changes in the historical context, leading to the inclusion of new perspectives from the Global South, the rise of women's movement, and various other social movements such as environmentalism and LGBTQ+ rights advocacy.\n\nThe 1960s pushed social theorists to pay more attention to processes of social change, social inequality, marginalization, and exploitation. They also examined power relations and the social movements that challenge them, as well as cultural and other differences among different individuals and groups. In this course, several major theoretical frameworks in modern social science will be introduced, including the Frankfurt School, Symbolic Interactionism, Post-structuralism, Feminism (specifically Standpoint Theory and Ecofeminism), and Post-colonial Theory. The works of influential social theorists like Herbert Marcuse, Patricia Hill Collins, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Pierre Bourdieu will form the foundation of our discussions.\n\nWhile reading original works by these theorists can be challenging, it is also an intellectually stimulating task. It allows students to form their own opinions about the ideas presented by these theorists. Throughout the course, we will explore various questions, such as how we can understand the social world, the impact of capitalism on our social reality, the construction of social reality, the causes of social change, the relationship between agency and structure, and the production of knowledge and by whom.\n\nAn essential component of the course involves applying different theoretical approaches to social phenomena, enabling us to examine the world around us through the lens of these theories. By doing so, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the social world and the factors that shape it.",

Nevertheless, people continue to migrate to cities and primarily to informal settlements. Despite their vulnerability to disaster, disease, violence, and cultural tensions, they also appear to be focal points of vitality, opportunity, and new initiatives. In many ways, 'the city' can be conceptualized as a contested site, a compact 'laboratory' where many of the tensions and opportunities related to globalization and development are acted out. Through lectures from ongoing research and selected readings, this course delves into the human aspects of these sites that embody contrasts and contradictions of social, economic, and political processes in cities of the Global South. We discuss connections and tensions between urban communities and economic development; the creation of vulnerable populations through urbanization and the precariousness of labor; the structural failures of slum ecologies and how they affect people, but also how citizens nevertheless find ways of making the city their home. In short, we aspire to infuse you with both how development and poverty of urban contexts are structurally reproduced in highly political ways and how 'cityness' also always depends on people who manage to flexibly and inventively arrange their lives on a daily basis.",

Activities that are seen as human rights violations by some legal systems are tolerated by others. Even more, activities that are seen to be human rights violations by some legal systems are seen to be rightful exercises of freedom by others. How deep are these disagreements?

Naturally, my freedom stops when your freedom starts, but how do we draw the line between different claims to freedom? What happens when human rights clash with the public interest?

However, as new threats to human well-being and security emerged during the end of the Cold War period, new schools of thought also arose in the field of Security Studies. Today, Contemporary Critical Security Studies encompasses a wide range of scholars, schools, approaches, and understandings.\n\nThis course explores various schools and approaches within Contemporary Critical Security Studies. It begins with an introduction to conventional security, namely Realism and Liberalism, but also explains why these approaches were deemed unsatisfactory by the academic community in the early 1990s. The course then delves into different theoretical positions, ranging from constructivism to Feminism (gender security), Green Theory (environmental security), and Post-Colonialism (security from non-Western perspectives).\n\nAdditionally, the course introduces contemporary concepts such as 'Securitisation,' which was developed by the Copenhagen School, and examines 'security networks' or 'security apparatus' as investigated by the Paris or Sociological school. Another relevant contemporary approach discussed is called 'Human Security,' with a focus on the development of this concept.\n\nOverall, the course aims to provide students of International Relations with an understanding of how Critical Security Studies has evolved as a distinct sub-field within the discipline. This development owes much to the contributions of the Wales or Aberystwyth Schools. Additionally, the course explores several contemporary issues such as poverty, migration, borders, cyberwar, new technologies and warfare, responsibility to protect, humanitarian intervention, the war against terror, and other contemporary security issues, offering students a broader perspective on the practical application of theories and approaches.",

The introduction furthermore includes an overview of the main mechanisms/components that can be part of the process of transitional justice and how they are interrelated. The course will subsequently address several of these transitional justice mechanisms, and in this analysis, we will predominantly focus on the perspectives of the victims. Victims (and survivors) are not only a group but also individual human beings, and their wishes and interests in the aftermath of large-scale conflict can be very diverse and even contradict the wishes of other victims or the group as such. What are their interests and what are their views on transitional justice, including possibilities of remedy and reparation? In this context, specific attention is given to the impact of violent conflict on women and children. \n\nThroughout the course, critical attention is paid to the following justice mechanisms: apologies and forgiveness, memorialization and commemoration, truth-telling and truth commissions, pardons and amnesties, compensation, restoration, restitution, international and regional criminal courts and tribunals, lustration and vetting. The analysis will be concluded with a discussion of the various justice mechanisms and their potential to contribute to (or jeopardize) sustainable peace. How effective are these approaches in breaking cycles of violence? Can they bring reconciliation? \n\nIn addition to issues such as justice and reconciliation, other matters are also significant in post-conflict societies as they greatly affect the consolidation of peace and stability. Justice and reconciliation only form one pillar of reconstruction, but also in other areas, constructive action is required. Such other areas of concern include, for instance, security, well-being, and governance. \n\nThe course therefore looks into the process of reconstruction and discusses which actions are required in order to move from the precarious early stages of post-conflict transition to a more sustainable situation that allows for the consolidation of peace and stability. Several lectures will be held during this course. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice. During the lectures, various guest speakers will address the subject matter from the practitioner\u2019s perspective. In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post-discussion. We hope that, through these documentaries, the subject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract. \n\nCase studies play an important role throughout the course, and we will, therefore, pay attention to a wide variety of cases, including the Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armenia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.). Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide, and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well.

While economic globalization, in general, and international trade, in particular, undoubtedly offer the possibility of unprecedented prosperity for people in both developed and developing countries, they also cause numerous problems and give rise to justified concerns. The challenge facing the international community is to manage and regulate economic globalization and international trade so that they benefit all of humankind. \n\nThe World Trade Organization, established in 1995, is at the forefront of the multilateral effort to manage and regulate economic globalization in general and international trade in particular. The law of the WTO governs the trade relations between the WTO\u2019s 164 Members but also concerns each of us directly, as it affects the price and quality of the goods and services we consume. Moreover, for many of us, our (future) job will be, directly or indirectly, related to (and sometimes threatened by) international trade. WTO rules have played an important role in mitigating the consequences of the 2008-9 Global Financial and Economic Crisis. \n\nIn the face of the dramatic drop in production and exports as well as high unemployment experienced by many countries during the 2008-9 crisis, it was feared that countries would resort to trade protectionist measures to support their domestic industries. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the adoption of such protectionist measures deepened and lengthened the economic crisis considerably, which in turn led to political upheaval and radicalization, international tension, and eventually, war. The WTO and its rules have contributed much to the fact that countries did not, in a significant manner, resort to disruptive protectionism in response to the Global Financial and Economic Crisis and that history did not repeat itself. However, continued vigilance is called for because unemployment, poverty, and inequality persist in many countries leading to pressure on governments by domestic industries calling for protection from foreign competition, with the trade war between the US and China being the most prominent example. \n\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the global economy may exacerbate this trend even further unless restrained by Members\u2019 respect for their legal obligations under WTO law. It is clear that WTO rules, most of which were adopted in 1995, are sorely in need of updating to reflect current economic, technological, and societal realities. Since 2001, WTO Members engaged in negotiations in the context of the WTO Doha Development Round on rules for the further liberalization of international trade. To the disappointment of many, several years of negotiations resulted in only limited agreements on new rules for international trade, achieved in Bali in December 2013 and in Nairobi in December 2015. However, in June 2022, at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO, Ministers adopted a package of agreements, including rules on fisheries subsidies and a waiver on patent protection of Covid-19 vaccines. Groups of WTO Members continue to work on specific areas such as e-commerce, sustainability, trade and gender, domestic regulation of services, and investment facilitation for development. \n\nThis introductory course on WTO law and policy is recommended to all students who want to gain a better understanding of the core institutional and substantive rules of the international trading system. This understanding will enable students to also appreciate some other recent developments in the field of international economic law, such as the proliferation of preferential trade agreements and the ongoing trade tensions between major trading powers in the world. Both are a response to the failure of the Doha Development Round to reach multilateral consensus, thereby shifting trade negotiations and actions partly away from the WTO. Depending on the political and economic position of the involved states, some of these agreements and actions may well set new standards for future international trade regulation. By taking this course, students will gain an understanding of not just the WTO but also of other recent developments in international economic relations. The course is built around a number of true-to-life international trade problems represented in the form of case studies. The course addresses six themes. It starts by examining the phenomenon of economic globalization and the arguments for and against free trade, as well as the role of law in international economic and trade relations. Secondly, the course looks at the history, objectives, structure, functions, decision-making, and membership of the WTO. Thirdly, the WTO's unique system for the resolution of trade disputes and its current crisis is discussed. Fourthly, the principles of non-discrimination in WTO law (namely the obligations of most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment) are examined. Fifthly, the WTO rules on market access, dealing with tariff barriers and some non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services are addressed. Finally, the provisions of WTO law that aim to balance trade liberalization with other societal values (such as health, environment, and security) by means of exceptions to WTO obligations are discussed.",

Its economic growth has allowed the country to seek a more significant role in shaping world politics. \n\nIn this advanced-level undergraduate course, we are trying to make sense of Chinese international relations and foreign policy -- how China approaches the world and what shapes its external behaviors -- in the contemporary era. This course begins with an introduction, laying out the overall course structure, introducing critical theoretical perspectives and approaches to Western and Chinese international relations theories. \n\nWeek 2 examines the historical overviews of Chinese foreign policy, as well as the leading domestic debates on it and examines the domestic and international determinants for a changing Chinese foreign policy from 1949 onwards. From Week 3 to 6, some of the core foreign policy interests for China (i.e., national reunification, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, performative legitimacy, and international recognition and status) are examined with corresponding country/region case studies. \n\nWeek 3 and 4 examine China\u2019s relationship with its nearest neighbors (i.e., Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula) and significant countries in Northeast and Southeast Asia, illustrating the critical challenges to Chinese national interests that occur on its border. Week 5 looks into Chinese relations with the U.S, exploring the development of the Sino-U.S relations, U.S military presence in Asia, the Obama administration\u2019s pivot to Asia, and also the recent Sino-U.S trade war. Week 6 takes a closer look at Chinese participation in international and regional institutions, identifying the general pattern of Chinese behaviors in the multilateral setting. \n\nThe course is then wrapped up in the final debate on the future role of China in the global order.",

While traditional scholars of international relations focused on relations between sovereign states, this course addresses the questions of governance in a globalizing world through an examination of the interactions between international organizations (IOs) and sovereign states in shaping the contemporary global order. Given that major IOs have been led by Western powers, exploring the emerging roles of China and India in the Western-centric governance architecture is of particular interest to us. \n\nThese two Asian giants have experienced unprecedented economic growth in the past decades as they have integrated more with the market economy since the 1980s. Their emerging roles as global players were acknowledged in the US National Intelligence Council\u2019s report in 2005, stating, \u201cIn the same way that commentators refer to the 1900s as the 'American Century,' the 21st century may be seen as a time when Asia, led by China and India, comes into its own.\u201d \n\nWe will start off by introducing the theoretical and historical perspectives on global governance. Week 2 will illustrate the rise and decline of American-led liberal international order. Acknowledging the rise of emerging powers in the current world order, Week 3 will discuss the changes of Chinese and Indian foreign policy strategies in international institutions and the rationales for their engagement. \n\nFocusing on the selected section of regimes, including climate change, infectious diseases, trade, and also foreign aid, Week 4 and 5 will examine the ways in which China and India engage to the existing global governance architecture, the tools they use, and the efforts they make to influence or redesign current Western-led international institutions. Week 6 will take a closer look at the involvement of China and India in regional institutions, such as Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). While the Chinese and Indian leadership has contributed to regional governance, key security challenges presented by the rising powers to their neighboring countries in Asia, such as territorial disputes and river basin management, will also be highlighted. \n\nWeek 7 will wrap up the course by considering the future of global governance: Can China and India collaborate on emerging global governance challenges?

        "desc": "Reading history is not the same as researching it. Researching history means pursuing one's own inquiry into the past, rather than following another historian's argument about the past. Above all, researching history implies not relying on \"second-hand\" information. Instead, it involves going back to the primary historical sources as much as possible. However, going back to the sources is not as simple and straightforward as it may sound. There are all sorts of difficulties involved, intellectual as well as practical. This skills training offers a first introduction to the ways historians deal with these difficulties. During the course, students will discuss the information value of several historical sources, especially public political statements, archival records, and public opinion sources. The sources that will be discussed are all related to one specific theme: the first European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1952 (and the first that ceased to exist in 2002). This early episode in the history of European integration is particularly well-suited for an introduction to historical research because a variety of archival and other primary sources is readily available. It is also an interesting topic because it has led to much controversy among historians. What was the role of the leading politicians and officials involved, especially Schuman and Monnet? To what extent did existing idealism about European unity play a role? Or was the initiative to establish the ECSC rather inspired by the national self-interest of the states involved? This skills training will be a useful guide to students who are keen on doing historical research in the future. But it will also prove to be of value to those with a general interest in history and in the history of the European integration process in particular. By offering knowledge and insights on how the historian works, it will mentally equip students to assess the strong and weak aspects of the histories they will be reading. This will enable them to inform themselves on specific topics, especially topics concerned with the process of European integration.",

If we want to bring about fundamental change in our societies, we need to become racially literate, which means developing the ability to discover racism in all its forms - subtle and overt, everyday and institutional - and we need to learn how it impacts ourselves and others. We will engage with critical approaches such as DTM, which stands for decolonizing the mind. This framework critically examines how knowledge was produced and propagated during slavery, colonialism, and imperialism and how this, in turn, still affects European societies today. The course builds on the premise that although white and BIPOC persons are affected differently by racism, all groups are deeply affected. In this course, however, we will spend a significant amount of time focusing on whiteness and the ways in which white people are complicit with racism. As Toni Morrison and others maintain, European slavery dehumanized not only the enslaved but also the enslavers. European slavery brought about an inversion of reality. It turned the perspective of the enslaver into objective reality. This is what Morrison means when she says white Europeans had to dehumanize; slavery was a time when reality became distorted. Nowadays, this expresses itself by forgetting the colonial past, by not seeing racism and racial injustice as it is happening right before one\u2019s eyes. By engaging in dialogues of race, we will relearn and reprocess emotions, thoughts, and perhaps ways of being in the world that come with the social construction of white racial identities. The recognition of racial codes and racialized practices will be refined through racial justice logs. Through detailed recordings of racialized situations in their everyday lives, participants will exercise their ability to recognize that they live in a racialized environment. Their day may start, for instance, by attending a university course in an almost exclusively white environment with a white curriculum and a white professor. During their lunch break, they may witness racial micro-aggressions against their fellow students of Asian descent in the streets of Maastricht, and it may end with a film where Blackness is represented in stereotypical ways. The Digital Story project, as the culmination of the course, will allow us to retell aspects of our biographies and/or family history from a racial justice perspective. If history is present in everything that we do, as James Baldwin argues, then where better to start than in our own family history? This is when an investigation into how race has been done throughout our lives becomes meaningful. Participants will use this multimedia platform to re-evaluate their lives using the tools and concepts they have learned in this course. As the study of larger racial discourses such as colorblindness, for instance, is an important aspect of anti-racism work, we will begin the process of unlearning practices that we have picked up since childhood. Throughout the course, we will grapple with France Twine\u2019s contention that racial identities are changeable and movable \u2013 at least to some extent. This may help us get away from monolithic ways of conceptualizing racial identities and instead adopt more fluid practices of speaking, writing, seeing, and perceiving.

Discourse analysis provides us with the methodology to critically evaluate naturalized uses of language and challenge the implicit knowledge that underlies our perceptions of reality. Following Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we will focus on conducting and integrating textual and contextual explorations of various written texts. In addition to applying analytical tools to texts, we will concentrate on how to connect textual representations and socio-political contexts, as well as how to link textual representations and the linguistic components of texts. For example, we will examine how the use of specific linguistic forms can create representations of individuals and their speech that convey ideologically loaded messages about them.

Additionally, an introduction to bad arguments, known as fallacies, is provided in this part.\n\nThe third part applies the knowledge and skills learned in the first two parts to analyze complete texts.

Qualitative researchers essentially study things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them (Ritchie 2003: 3). Ethnography is one form of qualitative research and means literally \"writing culture\" (Hesse-Biber 2006: 230). Often called \"participant observation\", ethnography is based on the simple idea that in order to understand what people are up to, it is best to observe them by interacting with them up close and personal within their everyday lives. Ethnographers provide detailed accounts of the everyday practices of a culture, subculture, organization or group by \"hanging out\", observing and recording the ongoing social life by taking fieldnotes and/or providing \"thick descriptions\" (Hesse-Biber 2006: 230). This is part one of an overall sequence of three skills trainings within which students design and implement their own study, analyze the data collected, and report on their research findings. In this first module, students will learn about various research tools, such as participant observation and qualitative interviewing. Students will learn how to take fieldnotes and will be introduced to various forms of interviewing, such as the structured interview, the in-depth interview, focus groups and life history interviews. Taking fieldnotes and interviewing will be practiced in and outside of the classroom. Moreover, students will be guided through the process of crafting a feasible research question and the appropriate design for the study that they will pursue in the follow up modules of this course. The research questions will provide the basis for students' investigations. What is to be investigated is entirely up to the student(s). However, they will be provided with guidance in the formulation of their topics.\n\nIn this course, students will have to conduct at least one interview, thus you will need to have access to a tape recorder and/or video camera. Note: This is a time and labor-intensive skills training, especially once you have begun data collection in the second module of the course. Most of the work that you are required to accomplish will occur outside of the class setting. Students are expected to work independently and should count on having to invest an extra two to four hours per week for interviewing, transcribing the interviews, and working on the data analysis.",

This model goes beyond the basic distinction of premises and conclusions as constituent parts of arguments by distinguishing the different functions that premises can fulfill. The Toulmin model is more flexible than argumentative analysis based on formal logic, but also more specific and logically rigorous than the tools introduced in Argumentation I. Therefore, it can be a powerful tool for specific and sophisticated argumentative analysis. Such analyses will be conducted during this skills training, first on small, simplified academic arguments, and afterwards on a larger scale, analyzing examples from real-life discourse. Finally, in the midterm assignment, students are asked to apply the Toulmin model to design an argument themselves.\n\nThe second part of the course takes the analysis of argumentative structures a step further, and the tools that are used are logically even more rigorous. This part introduces students to basic sentential logic, a strictly formal, almost mathematical approach to argument analysis. Sentential logic introduces a simple set of rules and procedures that allows students to test whether an argument is formally valid, i.e. if its structure is correct, independent of its content. To test for the validity of an argument in this way, the structure of English sentences will be separated from their content by translating the sentences into symbols; afterwards, formal rules will be applied (by using truth tables and semantic tableaus) to check whether an argument logically works or not.\n\nNote: Students should be aware of the abstract nature of formal logical reasoning when enrolling for this course. Learning this is highly valuable to train a particular way of thinking, but students might perceive this skill as less directly applicable to, for example, paper writing or discussions than the tools that are introduced in Argumentation I.",

Even in any chosen specific field, tens of thousands of articles are published each year. For example, during the COVID-19 outbreak, 23,500 articles were published on the topic in just the first wave. Any researcher or research-based professional is expected to synthesize the results of scientific studies for evidence-based decision making, regulatory approval, or to identify the gaps in literature that need further research. Research synthesis and systematic reviewing are rapidly evolving academic fields using dedicated study designs, software, and statistical tools with applications in all research domains.\n\nIn this semester, containing two skill trainings (in periods 4 and 5) and a project (in period 6), we will discuss the full scope of principles, concepts, and methods of systematic literature reviewing, including meta-analysis (statistical pooling of outcomes of included component studies). You will also gain hands-on coding experience with the statistical program R. Having some experience with statistics or coding will thus help but is not a prerequisite. The semester will teach you how to read and write academic papers. It is, as such, a good preparation for your capstone project and possibly later in your educational and academic career.\n\nThis Skills Course: Study Designs in Systematic Reviewing \n\nThis first part of this semester is a skills course. In a skills course, you will do more independent work than in a regular course. SKI3010 teaches you the general steps, procedures, and pitfalls of conducting narrative, scoping, and systematic reviews following international guidelines and industry standards. You will receive lectures, workshops, and tutorial group meetings. In most of the tutorial group meetings, you will make a start with your homework assignment - with a teacher available to get you started and to ask questions.\n\nAttention will be paid to issues like the various approaches to reviewing the literature; strengths and limitations of the systematic literature review; reviews dealing with various types of primary study; structure of a systematic review and steps in conducting a systematic review; strategies, tools, and sources for searching the literature; qualitative and quantitative data extraction from retrieved publications; and principles of methodological quality assessment of component studies (e.g., risk of bias assessment); levels of evidence and interpretation of review results; guidelines for systematic review protocol writing; guidelines for reporting on systematic reviews and computer software for systematic reviews.

Even in any chosen specific field, tens of thousands of articles are published each year. For example, during the COVID-19 outbreak, 23,500 articles were published on the topic in just the first wave. Any researcher or research-based professional is expected to synthesize the results of scientific studies for evidence-based decision making, regulatory approval, or to identify the gaps in literature that need further research.\n\nResearch synthesis and systematic reviewing are rapidly evolving academic fields using dedicated study designs, software, and statistical tools with applications in all research domains. In this semester, containing two skill trainings (in periods 4 and 5) and a project (in period 6), we will discuss the full scope of principles, concepts, and methods of systematic literature reviewing, including meta-analysis (statistical pooling of outcomes of included component studies). You will also gain hands-on coding experience with the statistical programme R. Having some experience with statistics or coding will thus help but is not a prerequisite. The semester will teach you how to read and write academic papers. It is, as such, a good preparation for your capstone project and possibly later in your educational and academic career.\n\nThis Skills Course: Statistics in Systematic Reviewing\n\nThis second part of this semester is a skills course, which goes beyond the systematic review. SKI3011 will give you the required statistical background to conduct a meta-analysis, a quantitative summary of all collected evidence. A meta-analysis is often needed for clinical application, policy advice, or regulatory approval. You will be trained in the statistical software R and run analyses for the identification of publication bias; (semi-)quantitative pooling of component study results (research synthesis, e.g., statistical pooling, best-evidence synthesis); assessment and exploration of heterogeneity of study results (e.g., outlier analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, meta-regression analysis); levels of evidence and interpretation of meta-analytic results; and computer software for meta-analysis.\n\nContrary to SKI3010, you will now choose your own topic to work on.",

As an academic, you visit a conference to present your own work, see others\u2019 work, and initiate possible collaborations.\n\nThis skills training focuses on the preparation and planning of a conference. Students will write extensive plans for the annual UCM Liberal Arts and Sciences conference to be held in the third period of this semester. In order to develop these plans, students will do the following:\n\n1) Discuss the shared assumptions, values, and goals of Liberal Arts and Sciences and an open curriculum, and turn that into a subtheme for the conference.\n2) Discuss and compare individual interests within the group to find similarities and differences, and turn that into workshops and lectures at the conference, which will be offered in collaboration with one to three fellow students.\n3) Discuss instructional design (teaching and learning) in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and use that to work out lesson plans for the conference workshops and lectures.\n4) Discuss PR and logistics, the opening session, the parallel session, and the closing session of the conference, and collect their preparations and plans in a team portfolio.\n\nNote that this skills training is not only about presentation skills and organization skills. It also aims to give students the opportunity to learn more about education, teaching, and instructional design. The skills training heavily relies on students\u2019 personal experiences from being in a liberal arts and sciences program for several semesters, and their ability to make that explicit to others. On one hand, this will be used while preparing the conference and informing first-semester UCM students. On the other hand, participating students will benefit from the skills training and its follow-ups by preparing for capstone and master\u2019s applications, for which a deep understanding and expression of their academic interests will be necessary.\n\nThe skills training emphasizes instructional design, viewing individual contributions to the conference as educational units. Participating students will have the opportunity to gain experience in developing and designing intended learning objectives, and then implementing teaching and learning activities for a target group and audience. Students will explore different approaches to teaching and apply them to preparing lesson plans for the lectures, workshops, and plenary sessions offered at the conference.

Deep reading is a process of thoughtful and deliberate reading through which a reader actively works to critically contemplate, understand, and ultimately enjoy a particular text to the fullest extent possible. Rather than selectively skimming for facts or speed-reading for summaries, the process of deep reading means slowing down, re-reading, and even stopping periodically to more fully contemplate specific pages or passages. Having considered and recognized what a text says, deep reading goes a step further and strives to reflect upon the broader implications or consequences of the text; i.e. what does the text 'do'?

In this project, students will engage with \u2018wicked\u2019 societal problems by using design thinking to find a solution to an issue associated with one of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (Figure 1). Figure 1: The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. \n\nThis approach is particularly apt for such difficult or intractable problems, having been developed to challenge existing assumptions, redefine problems, and ultimately develop meaningful products and services. As such, design thinking is a process for creative problem-solving that is used across industries, governments, not-for-profits, the cultural sector, and in research. There are many instances of this approach, take for example, the development of a lamp that uses solar energy developed for those who don\u2019t have (reliable) access to electricity, or a location-based game to engage visitors of cultural heritage sites. \n\nThe starting point for design thinking is that analyzing and discussing problems is not always the best way to solve them. This is especially true when we are facing new or particularly complex issues. In such cases, taking a design approach can be a better method to help to design solutions through an iterative design cycle (see Figure 2). This cycle includes identifying and understanding (empathizing) with the people that you are trying to design a solution for, only then do you define the problem, followed by iterating through ideas and possible solutions, before developing a prototype, testing it, and coming up with a final solution. Figure 2: A typical design thinking lifecycle approach to problem solving. \n\nIn this course, students will take a design thinking approach from empathizing through prototyping. Students will learn about theories and principles behind design thinking by actually doing design thinking through a project (of the student\u2019s choice) of social relevance.",

The coordinators will make a pre-selection of those policies that seem suitable for a team project. \n\nIn the first week of the project, students will jointly decide on the topic they will address based on this pre-selection. They will also design a research and workplan, and make agreements on how they will work together as a team. The second and third weeks will be dedicated to actual research on the policy, guided by the students' previously developed plan. During this time, students will also start working on their written policy analysis report and the presentation of it. \n\nIn the fourth week, the report and presentation will be finalized, and the different sub-groups will present their findings to each other. This will be rounded off with an evaluative workshop at the end of the project period. \n\nThe registration procedure for this project is as follows: As we start anew this year, there is a limited number of places available. If you would like to join, you need to apply by filling in the application form on the intranet (UCM Students). During the course registration period, we will make available some broad topic areas on the intranet.

This can be a topic within the suggested broader topic areas or something else. Guidelines for writing your proposal will be provided on the intranet. You will also need to provide your motivation to follow the project, including how participating adds to your curriculum, how your participation adds to the project, why you think you are well prepared to follow the project, and an overview of the relevant courses you have taken that can contribute to the project. \n\nThe application needs to be submitted in advance of the course registration deadline.

This will allow the University of Maastricht (UCM) to offer courses on countries or regions that aren't covered by the expertise of UCM/UM staff members. These courses can focus on themes, topics, and concerns that are of special interest to different regions and in which partnering universities have expert knowledge.\n\nThe goal of this project is for students to combine their knowledge from previous courses on internationally relevant historical developments, socio-cultural patterns, economic trends, and political systems with analytical and communicative competencies gained from previous skills modules. All of this will revolve around a theme proposed and introduced by the foreign-based co-coordinator of the course. The project is designed to be adaptable to different international contexts, much like a Think Tank.\n\nIn January 2023, the project on offer will focus on contemporary Japanese politics. Dr. Anoma van der Veere from Osaka University will be the co-coordinator. Participating students will explore whether it's possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of Japanese politics through the lens of popular culture. Traditionally, information about a nation's political system is explored and communicated through historical, legal, and policy documents. However, popular culture, including anime, manga, movies, television dramas, and music, is inherently political itself. It can represent the \"ideal Japanese home\" as the extended family or exhibit overtly anti-foreign sentiments, particularly regarding foreign security threats.\n\nStudents will be expected to analyze various forms of media and deconstruct the embedded narratives in order to interpret the political messages conveyed through popular culture products. They will then compare and contrast these messages with more traditional approaches to examining Japanese politics. It's important to note that for an authentic experience, the tutor for this project is based at Osaka University and will attend sessions online.

Violence happens everywhere \u2013 at work, in schools, in healthcare facilities, on the streets, and at home. In our constantly evolving society, it has become one of the biggest societal issues to tackle. No matter which field of study a student focuses on, how to tackle crime and violence is relevant for everyone. True comprehension of violence lies at the intersection of various disciplines. Facilitating such understanding will enable students to translate the complex nature of violence into practical prevention strategies and encourage curiosity beyond disciplinary boundaries. Students will identify situations in which violence presents a problem and, where possible, will interact with societal partners to develop potential solutions. In this project, students will transform their newly acquired knowledge and skills into practical implementation by applying them directly to society's needs based on requests of the stakeholders.

In academia, too, visual methods are increasingly part of the toolkit used to do research and share research with both specialist and general audiences. Audiovisual media, like documentaries, can broaden the topics we can research, add new dimensions to the knowledge we create, and make scientific findings accessible to diverse audiences.

Students who are interested in participating are invited to consult the list of clients on the UCM Intranet (see: https://intranet .maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/ucm -students/courses/research -based -learning -courses/applied -research -and-internship -project -ari). The list will be published at the start of course registration period. Specific prerequisites in terms of courses and skills appl y for each case. If you would like to join the ARI project you need to apply for it by filling in the application form on the Intranet page (s ee above link). Part of this form asks you to elaborate on your motivation to follow the project. This should cov er an explanation as to how participating in the project adds to your curriculum, why you think you are well prepared to follow the project and an overview of the relevant courses you took. You also need to submit a CV and you might be invited for a person al interview with the client and the academic supervisor. The application needs to be submitted in advance of the course registration deadline. If eligible, you can be invited for an interview. This is a selective project. Therefore, the course coordinator s reserve the right to only select the students that are deemed most suitable. It will be communicated in a timely manner, but no later than 6 weeks before the start of the project, whether the application for the project was successful.

        "desc": "In this project, students will apply their academic knowledge and skills to a case presented by an external client, such as a company, NGO, or governmental organization. The student will produce an academically-grounded, but practically useful work product that satisfies the needs of the client and UCM's academic requirements. The nature of the work product will vary depending on the discipline, client, and case.\n\nThe research in this module is practice-based and tailored to the needs of an external client. Simultaneously, the work for the client is research-oriented. The core of the project is the research conducted by the student based on the case presented by the client. In order to gain knowledge about the client's professional environment, the context of the case, and the stakeholders involved, the module includes a four-week period of on-site work at the client's workplace during the project period, which serves as an internship.\n\nAdditionally, the project includes two periods of seven weeks in which the student works on the project independently one day per week. The specific structure of the project and the tasks assigned during each period depend on the individual assignment given to the student. At the end of the semester, the student presents their work to both the client and the academic supervisor.\n\nSimilar to MaRBLe and The Documentary, the Applied Research & Internship project spans a full semester and replaces two skills courses and one project. No general literature is assigned; instead, students are required to select their own literature and conduct research that is relevant to their specific case.",
