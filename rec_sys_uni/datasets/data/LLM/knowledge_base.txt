Title of the course: Philosophy of Science. Typical issues in this course are: What is the role of observation in science? What is a scientific explanation? What roles do theories and experiments play in science? What is the nature of scientific progress? Can we rationally decide between scientific viewpoints? In what ways are the social sciences similar to or different from the natural sciences? The course presents an introduction to major issues in the philosophy of science.It can be divided into four parts.In the first, we will deal with traditional positions on the objectivity and methodology of science, like those of logical empiricism.The second focuses on objections to this received view as formulated by critical rationalism and by Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm theory.Kuhn’s theory revolutionized thinking about scientific knowledge and led to the so-called sociological and historical turn in the philosophy of science.
Title of the course: Philosophy of Science. The course then addresses two fundamental problems in the field: ‘Do our theories describe reality?’ (The problem of realism) and ‘Do we now have better knowledge than in the past?’ (The problem of cognitive progress).In the final part of the course, problems in the philosophy of the social sciences will take center stage: How do the social sciences explain and predict events? Does the method of understanding present an alternative methodology for social science? And finally, what is the role of social science in society..

The Philosophy of Science has the following ILOs: To familiarize students with the philosophical foundations of the scientific method.. 
Title of the course: Contemporary World History. The course intends to trace back current situations to their historical backgrounds.The first three tasks, under the caption "Toolkit", will therefore consist of a brief exploration of the philosophy of history and some issues regarding historical perspective, a discussion of the concepts of "state" versus 'nation' (in anticipation of issues regarding decolonization, specific regional conflicts, and possible sources of conflict in general that will be discussed in later tasks) and the global market, and a discussion of the Cold War as an influential factor in recent history.Each of the following tasks, under the captions of "Area surveys" and "Assessment of the current global situation" respectively, will be built around a case that represents the underlying problem, and both combined will lead students to specific source material.
Title of the course: Contemporary World History. Examples of such cases are decolonization, the economic development of Asia, conflict in Africa, and the implications of a decline in Liberal Democracies and the possible decline of the US as the 'solitary superpower.'.

The Contemporary World History has the following ILOs: To provide students with an understanding of the main trends in politics, economics, demography, society, and culture since 1945 and to put these trends in a global context., To develop a critical attitude towards the use of historical theory, the interpretation of historical data, and processes.. 
Title of the course: Political Philosophy. Politics is a complex and puzzling subject.If only taken at their word, it is difficult to understand why people act the way they do and believe the things they purport to believe in.As political philosophers, we try to understand the underlying conceptions and values that shape politics and are used to justify concrete policies.We are not concerned with what people claim to believe, but rather with the underpinning structures, values, and ideas that shape how we live together.We are concerned with how the language and concepts that people use come to define who they are.In other words, we don't have ideas, ideas have us.Our task in this course is to understand those ideas.This course will provide an introduction to contemporary philosophical debates about core political concepts such as justice, liberty, equality, community, and democracy in modern liberal-democratic societies.
Title of the course: Political Philosophy. Students will become familiar with the thought of some of the leading modern political philosophers, like Thomas Hobbes, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Rawls, Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Frantz Fanon, Martha Nussbaum, and Achille Mbembe.Since conceptual analysis is the core business of philosophy, students will learn to analyze concepts, clarify fuzzy moral ideas, and make explicit the tensions and contradictions inherent to our political lives.Students will also learn how to apply these concepts to current political debate and practice..

The Political Philosophy has the following ILOs: The course will provide an introduction to Western political philosophy. Students will learn to analyze, discuss, and apply basic concepts in contemporary political philosophy such as justice, equality, liberty, and community., Students will apply these core concepts to various local, national, and global political issues, such as migration and global justice., Students will be trained in normative political argumentation. They will exercise their ability to debate contentious ethical issues of public life.. 
Title of the course: Science, Reason and Human Progress. Science never stands still, and for some time now, there appears to be a growing shift in intellectual enquiry and discovery toward more cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary thinking.The core course Science, Reason and Human Progress takes this observation as a starting point.In doing so, its ultimate goal is to make students aware of the value of scientific inquiry across different academic domains and of its fundamental relevance to societal developments.Such awareness can only be developed by first getting a basic understanding of ‘how scientific inquiry works’.To achieve this, the course has three aims that are more specific.The first aim is to introduce students to scientific thought, language, and behavior and their relation to human progress.
Title of the course: Science, Reason and Human Progress. In this context, it will become clear that academic, scientific, and intellectual work interacts with political, social, and moral change, which in turn often starts with scientific inquiry.The second aim is to help students develop and apply scientific inquiry skills.The third aim is teaching Liberal Arts & Science students to recognize how they can become part of this change in scientific and human progress that scientific inquiry brings about and possibly even lead it.In order to do so, throughout the course, emphasis lies on recognition of past, present, and (possible) future scientific works (theory and applications)..

The Science, Reason and Human Progress has the following ILOs: Students learn to recognize, define, and analyze scientific and intellectual achievements grounded in the Enlightenment and describe their relation to human progress., Students learn to review scientific theory and thought, scientific jargon, and its application in a critical manner., Students are encouraged to recognize and illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of successful scientific endeavor., Students are trained to apply the scientific inquiry method. In addition, they practice cross- and interdisciplinary thought and use it to review and report solutions to a real-world issue.. 
Title of the course: Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies. Cultural Studies is a wide-ranging interdisciplinary inquiry into the ways in which contemporary culture, especially popular culture, operates and functions.It explores how cultural processes and artifacts are produced, distributed, and consumed, and traces the diverse ways in which people shape and transform culture particularly in relation to issues of identity, difference, and power.In contrast to more traditional approaches to culture, Cultural Studies focuses not merely on 'elevated' cultural objects such as 'great' works of art and literature, but also - and primarily - deals with more mundane cultural phenomena.Addressing topics that range from fashion advertisements to Instagram, and from science fiction to Lady Gaga, Cultural Studies zooms in on seemingly familiar, yet highly complex, practices of everyday life.This course introduces you to the key thinkers, topics, and critical frameworks in Cultural Studies.
Title of the course: Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies. It starts with some of the foundational texts and formative debates within the field, most notably the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Stuart Hall, associated with the Frankfurt School and Birmingham School respectively.Subsequently, we will take a closer look at several topical debates and conceptual approaches within contemporary Cultural Studies.We will address themes such as consumer culture, advertising, and social networks; the power and politics of representation; material culture and identity; cultural performances of gender; and the transnational cultural flows of globalization.By reading the work of major theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman, Henry Giroux, and Joanna Zylinska, you will familiarize yourself with a variety of critical approaches to cultural theory.
Title of the course: Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies. Lastly, by looking at the interrelated topics of posthumanism, art, and technoscience, the final tasks of the course will explore some of the most stirring debates within Cultural Studies today, setting out new directions for the future development of the field..

The Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the foundational texts and formative debates that have shaped Cultural Studies as an academic field of inquiry., To familiarize students with key concepts, themes, and topical debates within contemporary Cultural Studies, To introduce students to some of the central theoretical approaches within Cultural Studies, including critical theory, semiotics, material culture studies, gender theory, and critical posthumanism., To provide students with the analytical skills to develop their own examination of cultural objects and processes.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Philosophy. One of the greatest and most influential ancient philosophers, Aristotle of Stageira (384-322 BC), once remarked, "Wonder is the beginning of philosophy." What he was referring to is our habit of asking fundamental questions about our everyday life.Questions such as, "Suppose I am certain that I am right about something, what is that certainty based upon?" or "Suppose I am engaged in a discussion with someone (for example, about some controversial matter), what can objectively guarantee the stringency of my argument?" Thinking about and discussing such questions will force us to reconsider the things we have always taken for granted.Ultimately, they will lead us to more fundamental questions about the proper nature of truth and knowledge itself.Assignments during the course include the nature of philosophical inquiry, problems of knowledge and truth (including the understanding and evaluation of arguments), and ethics..

The Introduction to Philosophy has the following ILOs: To teach students how to "think philosophically".. 
Title of the course: Common Foundations of Law in Europe. What do Europeans have in common? Part of the answer to this question is their law.Currently, approximately 50% of all new legislation in the member states of the European Union has a non-national, European origin.This international outlook on law in Europe is not a new phenomenon.Even when concentrating on the so-called 'national laws' of the various European nations, it must be admitted that these laws find a strong foundation in a non-national, truly European tradition.This tradition dates back to the Middle Ages.Since it is the conviction of the course coordinator that a true understanding of the growing importance of the European institutions and policies can only be achieved by understanding the common legal history of Europe, the present course concentrates on this shared (legal) past.In doing so, it takes as its focal point the ius commune, i.e.
Title of the course: Common Foundations of Law in Europe. the common, scholarly European approach to the law that originated in the Middle Ages and that was strongly based on Roman Law.This medieval tradition forms the common ground on which the present national legal systems in Europe have developed.It has strongly contributed to the creation of the idea of a common European culture.In a manner that is highly relevant for an audience of non-lawyers and lawyers alike, the course starts with discussing Roman Law.The so-called Corpus Iuris Civilis will be used as the point of departure since most of what we know about Roman Law derives from this compilation of legal materials that was made in the 6th century AD on the orders of the Byzantine emperor Justinian.The texts that this emperor included in his collection were the product of a thousand years of unbroken legal development.
Title of the course: Common Foundations of Law in Europe. During this millennium, roughly from 500 BC to 550 AD, Rome expanded from a small city-state to a world empire.While Roman law was adapted to cope with the changing society, the idea was maintained that it was essentially the same law that had been part of the early Roman way of life.The course will also concentrate on the different approach to the law that existed and still exists in Anglo-American jurisdictions.It will try to explain the legal differences today between continental Europe and the British Isles.Additionally, some elements of American legal history will be studied.In doing so, the many similarities that lie beneath the seemingly radically different outward appearance of law in Anglo-American jurisdictions will come to light.This exercise will demonstrate that Anglo-American law is not so different from continental European law as some writers would like us to believe.
Title of the course: Common Foundations of Law in Europe. The course will conclude with a study of a selection of similarities and differences that exist in today’s European legal landscape..

The Common Foundations of Law in Europe has the following ILOs: To provide students with a better understanding of law as a harmonizing phenomenon in European culture., To provide students with a basic understanding of similarities and differences in the approach to law in the various member states of the European Union (and the USA)., To give students a better understanding of basic legal concepts such as property, contract, and tort., To provide students with a greater ability to evaluate the significance of the transfer of law-making powers from the national to the European institutions.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Art; Representations, Performances and Interactions. The traditional term for the many ways in which artworks represent reality is mimesis.The mimetic talent for imitation and representation has been the subject of admiration, study, and debate throughout the history of Western art.The notion of mimesis is employed to describe painting, literature, music, theater, dance, and more; it is still used to characterize the domain of the arts in general.In engaging with the concept of mimesis, this course focuses on three central themes and approaches.The first part of the course is concerned with representations of reality in nineteenth and early twentieth-century literature, painting, and music.The second part deals with modern and contemporary performance art.
Title of the course: Introduction to Art; Representations, Performances and Interactions. The academic field of Performance Studies is introduced in an attempt to deal with the blurring of genres, cultures, and conventions that are typical for contemporary art shaped by mass media and processes of globalization.The third and last part of the course discusses sociological perspectives on art as a social practice and a collective activity.This course, through its emphasis on representations, performances, and interactions, constitutes a basis for courses on the arts in all their diversity, as well as courses on culture and cultural studies in general.The course includes a practical, creative exercise on the role of style in representation..

The Introduction to Art; Representations, Performances and Interactions has the following ILOs: To provide students with an advanced introduction to the visual and performing arts., To broaden the students' theoretical understanding of art.. 
Title of the course: Pop Songs and Poetry: Theory and Analysis. In the course Poetry and Pop Songs, we will be reading English and American poetry from the 20th and 21st century.We will also unravel the work from a variety of older and newer music artists, ranging for example from U2 and Coldplay to Rihanna and P!nk.Moreover, you are encouraged to look for additional examples of poems and songs to discuss and analyze in class.In this course, you will learn how to interpret poetry and popular music in a systematic and sophisticated way, and to write an in-depth analysis of a song or poem.The focus rests with the analysis of the lyrics or 'text' of the poems and songs.First, you will learn how to make use of insights and tools from literary theory in order to find out how (specific) poems work, which effects they evoke, and what they mean.You will also learn how to apply these tools to the analysis of song texts.
Title of the course: Pop Songs and Poetry: Theory and Analysis. In this course, we use a broad definition of pop songs, focusing on contemporary popular music, which means including other genres than just conventional pop music, such as rap, hip-hop, and rock.We will also pay some (albeit limited) attention to musical aspects - such as rhythm - of the songs at hand, to see how they interact with the lyrics.Once you have become familiar with the analysis of the lyrics, we will expand our focus to include an analysis of performance (including music videos) in the last week of the course.In this course, you will also experience the creative process that underlies all poetry and song, in a variety of ways: - you will learn to recite or sing a poem or song; - you will hear from experienced artists how they approach writing a poem or song; - you will write a poem or a song of your own.Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to issues of gender and diversity.
Title of the course: Pop Songs and Poetry: Theory and Analysis. We will address the question of how gender, ethnicity and sexuality can be integrated into an analysis of the lyric..

Title of the course: The Idea of Europe: The Intellectual History of Europe. This course deals with some of the most fundamental questions concerning the development of the European Identity.What have been the decisive common experiences that have fostered a sense of European community and identity, and how have they evolved over time? Tracing those events and experiences in the past that have helped to shape some sense of European community and identity means establishing the factors that have contributed to the difference between Europe and the non-European world.The concept of identity logically consists of two components: the notion of historical continuity and a marked sense of difference between the "in-group" and one or more significant others.If we accept that there is some sort of European identity, albeit complex and multifaceted, we should ask which factors have generated it.
Title of the course: The Idea of Europe: The Intellectual History of Europe. To put it more specifically: Which factors contributed to Europe's Sonderweg in world history? Or, to use the words of one author, the historian E.L.Jones: how did "the European miracle" come about?

From the angle of world history, the European experience constitutes a major deviation from an almost universal pattern of social and political organization.Europe is the first region in the world that has changed into a large-scale industrial and urban society.This so-called process of modernization has turned European civilization into something of a historical anomaly - the kind of anomaly, however, that forced itself on other continents, thus becoming a new kind of standard in the end after all.
Title of the course: The Idea of Europe: The Intellectual History of Europe. To ask for the factors that have contributed to the modern sense of European community and identity is, at least for a large part, to ask for the factors that have produced this phenomenon of modernization, including the blatant economic disparities between European civilization (including North-America) and the rest of the world..

The The Idea of Europe: The Intellectual History of Europe has the following ILOs: To provide students with an overview of the concept of Europe and the development of European identity., To highlight the specific characteristics of European political/social/cultural history, notably in comparison with that of other (non-European) societies, that contribute to a sense of European community and the European identity., To demonstrate how a sense of community could evolve from the many shared historical cultural factors., To provide students with an introduction to a range of theories that are fundamental to a range of courses at UCM.. 
Title of the course: Telling Stories. Easy to read on your smartphone, sometimes in just a couple of minutes while waiting for your bus or train, short fiction has become increasingly popular over the past few years.However, this literary genre has a long-standing tradition.In this course, we will delve into the history and genre of the short story by reading and analyzing several impactful stories, as well as creating our own.We will explore various aspects and concepts such as genre, plot, beginnings and endings, characters, settings, point of view, narration, texture and pace, style, and reflect on the dynamic relationship between the author, the text, and the reader.Combining academic analysis with hands-on creative writing, this course will offer you a deeper understanding of narrative techniques and how they convey meaning.Through rewriting stories, you will gain insight into literary theories and concepts, and simultaneously enhance your own writing skills.
Title of the course: Telling Stories. Peer and tutor feedback will play a vital role in this course.The collection of short stories we explore may vary each year, but it aims to encompass a diverse range of stories and authors.This year, we will engage with works by renowned authors such as Virginia Woolf, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Kazuo Ishiguro, Chinua Achebe, Bernadine Evaristo, and Sally Rooney..

The Telling Stories has the following ILOs: You have a deeper understanding of the genre of short fiction., You know how stories work and how to analyze them academically., You are familiar with key literary concepts and theories and know how to use them to analyze fiction., You have a good understanding of the craft of writing short stories and have honed your creative writing skills.. 
Title of the course: The Making of Crucial Differences: ‘Race’, Sexuality, Gender, and Class in Historical Perspective. The Making of Crucial Differences offers a historical perspective on the ways in which the social categories of gender, race, class, and sexuality have made a difference, from the Enlightenment up to the mid-twentieth century, with a prelude that deals with early modernity.The course introduces students to seminal approaches within gender studies, postcolonial studies, and queer theory as critical lenses for analyzing different historical case studies.It inquires into the ways in which dominant Western discourses of identity have formed divisions between self and other, black and white, the Orient and the West, male and female, hetero- and homosexual, upper and lower class.In other words, it explores how these differences served to construct and maintain cultural hierarchies and social inequalities.
Title of the course: The Making of Crucial Differences: ‘Race’, Sexuality, Gender, and Class in Historical Perspective. The historical perspective of this course implies a sustained focus on the co-construction of gender, sexuality, race, and class as categories that shaped – and were shaped by – the entangled histories of capitalism, colonialism, slavery, and modern science..

The The Making of Crucial Differences: ‘Race’, Sexuality, Gender, and Class in Historical Perspective has the following ILOs: To acquaint students with a critical perspective on modern, primarily European history and the 'dialectic of Enlightenment', which means to demonstrate how the accomplishments of Enlightened ideals, etc., were interconnected with colonialism, the 'Jewish question', gender and class inequities., To familiarize students with a historical perspective and historical knowledge on the production and impact of configurations of 'race,' class, gender, and sexuality from the Enlightenment until the Shoah/Holocaust., To introduce students to canonical philosophical and theoretical texts on 'race' and 'gender', 'anti-Semitism' and 'orientalism', and to major texts in the field of historical gender and diversity studies like Foucault's "History of Sexuality"., To acquaint students with the way in which these configurations, such as gender, race, and religion, have structured cultural scripts and practices, stereotypes, individual identities, and European and North American developments, like slavery., To introduce students to the critical role literature can play within the dynamics of social change and cultural discourse., To provide students with the analytical skills to examine the dynamics of the production and reproduction of identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality. Disciplinary perspectives: Gender and Postcolonial Studies, History, Philosophy, Literary Studies, Cultural Studies, Sociology.. 
Title of the course: Enlightenment and Romanticism. The debate between Enlightenment and Romanticism has an enduring impact on discussions today in art, politics, science, human identity, and social values.We can hardly understand the Western world without knowledge of these two decisive periods.This interdisciplinary course is a systematic introduction to these two formative and opposed intellectual traditions.First, a historical context will be presented on the political and ideological ambitions of the Enlightenment (enlightened despotism, Voltaire at the court of Frederick the Great, censorship, and the diffusion of the Enlightenment).Secondly, the opposed approach to 'Nature' will be introduced, including the influence of Newton, the rise of modern science, the Encyclopédie vs.Romantic science (e.g.Goethe’s criticism of Newton’s Theory of Colour), and the role of the arts in the new approach to Nature (such as landscape painting and romantic poetry).
Title of the course: Enlightenment and Romanticism. Then, the changes in the visual arts will illustrate continuity and discontinuity in cultural history (Romanticism and Neo-Classicism).In the fourth place, human subjectivity in the Enlightenment (based on Lockean psychology and self-love) will be confronted with new approaches to the romantic soul (the unconsciousness, irrationality, Weltschmerz).This will also be discussed with an analysis of the famous movie Dangerous Liaisons (Stephen Frears, 1988).Finally, discussions about morals and politics will be presented (Rousseau, the Social Contract, the slogans of the French Revolution vs.Romantic values concerning the State and personal relationships like love and friendship, nationalism)..

The Enlightenment and Romanticism has the following ILOs: To provide students with a historical and philosophical introduction to the Enlightenment and Romanticism., To understand these periods as opposed worldviews in social, philosophical, scientific, and political perspectives; to deepen our insight into our paradoxical experience of ourselves and the world around us., To learn how much our life and culture are determined by enlightened and romantic views and values: our obsession with authenticity, nationalism; our attitude towards science and technology; belief in democracy; our emotional life; personal relationships like love and friendship; the importance of nature; universal human (and animal) rights; identity, etc.. 
Title of the course: States and Nations in Europe, from the Middle Ages to the First World War. Contrary to what many politicians claim, especially within the far-right camp, states and nations as we know them today have not always been around.In fact, scholars have repeatedly proven that both are products of history, which emerged as a result of specific circumstances.This course analyzes the emergence and development of states, nations, and nationalism in Europe since the Middle Ages and addresses historical events and key forces that have shaped the contemporary world.Furthermore, this course studies how emerging states and nations interact with each other, thus creating the fundamental organizing principle of the interstate order.Indeed, this course introduces students to the development of international relations and diplomacy from the High Middle Ages until the year 1919..

The States and Nations in Europe, from the Middle Ages to the First World War has the following ILOs: To discuss the development of "the state" as well as the diversity in state- and nation-building since the Middle Ages., To examine nation-building and nationalism in Europe, addressing the debates on how far back their origins can be traced., To introduce students to the history of international relations from the fifteenth century until 1919.. 
Title of the course: Ancient Philosophy. Why would anyone choose to study philosophers who lived and wrote more than two millennia ago? One obvious answer is: to learn about one’s roots; to better understand Western culture and heritage.Up to this day, the ancient Greeks constitute a major influence on our ideas about critical thinking, about the fundamental character of reality, about science, ethics, and art, and last but not least: about what it is to be human and about what it means for humans to flourish, to live truly good lives.Ancient philosophy provides an inexhaustible source of inspiration for contemporary philosophy.“The European philosophical tradition,” the philosopher Whitehead once remarked, “consists in a series of footnotes to Plato.” Slightly overstated, but not untrue.In this course, we will return to the sources and study the texts that helped us become who we are today.
Title of the course: Ancient Philosophy. We will analyze a range of canonical philosophical texts from Antiquity, ranging from the Ionian Philosophers of Nature to Aristotle, and beyond.Although we will attempt to position these treatises in their historical and geographic contexts, our main concern will be: what do these ancient thinkers still have to say to us today? Please note: even if you have some prior knowledge of ancient Greek philosophy, that doesn’t make this an easy course.Only choose this course if you are genuinely interested in reading intellectually challenging texts that do not always yield their secrets easily..

The Ancient Philosophy has the following ILOs: To provide you with a basic introduction to ancient Greek philosophy:, To help you explore the meaning of philosophical texts, we aim to situate them in their historical contexts., To help you find out how our culture, and we as part of it, have been shaped by these ancient thinkers, learning resources are required.. 
Title of the course: The Presence of Art: Reinterpreting Modern and Contemporary Art. Since the late 19th century and certainly up until the mid-20th century, artists have issued avant-garde manifestoes of change, claiming their art to be ahead of the times.Critical of conventions and traditions, they regarded art as a revolutionary means to social, political, cultural, and intellectual emancipation and progress.Through what has been called the "shock of the new," by making tabula rasa with the existing, art was to create a better world.Were it not for the fact that art effectively served the ideologies of both the socialist and fascist totalitarianisms of the last century, such radical ambitions might even sound a bit naïve, nowadays.
Title of the course: The Presence of Art: Reinterpreting Modern and Contemporary Art. Indeed, as yesterday's future has become today's past, the utopias of a bygone era seem to have been disappointed, at last - or have they not? Do we need to rescue avant-garde virtues and ideals for the sake of the relevance of contemporary art? What precisely is the legacy of the modern avant-garde besides its success on the global art market? In the early 21st century and under the spell of a "new spirit of capitalism," is there any hope left for effective artistic critique? Or do current "economies of enrichment" simply reduce the value of art to financial speculation? This course considers histories and theories of modern and contemporary art.It provides an overview of the heterogeneous and experimental development of modern and contemporary art.Artistic responses to society, politics, science, and technology are discussed.
Title of the course: The Presence of Art: Reinterpreting Modern and Contemporary Art. The module also addresses the practices of governing institutions of the contemporary art world, such as art markets and museums.Furthermore, the course features visits to local art institutions in Maastricht, including the Jan van Eyck Academie..

The The Presence of Art: Reinterpreting Modern and Contemporary Art has the following ILOs: To study historical and theoretical approaches to modern and contemporary art., To enable critical reflection and debate on the meaning and relevance of artistic practice., To learn how to write an art review, we need to understand the essence of the artwork and express our thoughts effectively.. 
Title of the course: Heritage Studies: Preserving Our Natural and Cultural Pasts (and Futures). Heritage is often viewed as something physical that needs to be preserved, such as pristine landscapes or monumental architecture.However, in this course, we take a different approach to heritage.We don't limit it to material culture or isolated ecosystems that need protection.Instead, we see heritage as human practices that hold values like authenticity, integrity, and sustainability.One of the main ideas of this course is that heritage, whether tangible or intangible, always involves the creation and recreation of various political, technological, and ethical relationships and meanings related to the past, present, and future.In other words, heritage is not just a passive thing, it is something that is constantly being done.
Title of the course: Heritage Studies: Preserving Our Natural and Cultural Pasts (and Futures). In this course, we ask questions like who is involved in heritage preservation, what do they do, how do they do it, and why? We will explore the histories, theories, and practices of preserving both natural and cultural heritage.We will also learn about the national laws and international agreements that exist to protect heritage, and we will examine the emergence of new economic systems centered around the value of heritage.Additionally, we will have the opportunity to meet with experts and managers from various heritage fields, as well as visit governmental and non-governmental heritage institutions.By critically analyzing how heritage values are constructed and legitimized, this course aims to place contemporary heritage practices within the broader global context of heritage.
Title of the course: Heritage Studies: Preserving Our Natural and Cultural Pasts (and Futures). This context consists of administrative systems, technical infrastructures, and value systems that revolve around contested notions of heritage and that may go beyond the boundaries of individual nations.As one of the foundational texts of critical heritage studies from the 1980s puts it, "The Past is a Foreign Country." But in this anthropocentric 21st century, where can we actually find "the past," if it even exists at all? In times marked by global humanitarian and ecological crises, where there are conflicting appeals for both development and conservation, is there still room for nostalgia? And how can we honor the diversity of our pasts while preserving the potential heritage futures we have today? These are questions we will explore in this course..

The Heritage Studies: Preserving Our Natural and Cultural Pasts (and Futures) has the following ILOs: To introduce the history and theories of heritage preservation., To critically analyze heritage practices., To relate heritage studies to current issues.. 
Title of the course: Cultural Diversity in a Globalizing World. This course problematizes the link between culture and globalization, with a focus on how the political, economy, and social transformations which signal the era of globalization intersect and transform cultural production and identity.It seeks to analyze how globalization influences identity and culture and the ways in which these interact with social differences such as race, gender, and class.Students will become acquainted with different theories of globalization and culture such as Edward Said’s influential theory of orientalism, Anna Tsing’s formulations around the ‘frictions’ of global interconnectedness, and Gloria Wekker’s deconstruction of Dutch multiculturalism.
Title of the course: Cultural Diversity in a Globalizing World. Moreover, the course encourages students to critically think on the questions raised by globalization in regards our relation to our natural environment and wider ecological questions, and to relate the thematic raised by the course to pressing issues of our day.Themes: Cultural Diversity; Gender and Ethnicity; Multiculturalism; Orientalism; Occidentalism; Migration; Ecology; Capitalism Disciplinary perspectives: Cultural Studies, Migration Studies, Gender and Diversity Studies, Sociology..

The Cultural Diversity in a Globalizing World has the following ILOs: To teach students to reflect upon issues of globalization and cultural diversity from various disciplinary perspectives and connect these issues with their academic major field of study.. 
Title of the course: Medieval Civilization: Making the Middle Ages Relevant. The Middle Ages (500-1500) are often seen as a grim period in European history, riddled with famine, disease, warfare, and intellectual stagnation.From the 'Dark Ages' of the Early Middle Ages to the calamitous 14th century - when the Great Famine, the Hundred Years' War, and the Black Death consecutively wreaked havoc on Europe - the Medieval period seems like an alien, hazardous world that is of little relevance for contemporary issues.Yet the Middle Ages also gave us some of the most impressive feats of human engineering as well as timeless works of art and literature.More importantly, the Medieval period heralded momentous societal changes that have shaped our current society.In late 2019, Chris Jones, Conor Kostick, and Klaus Oschema published an edited volume titled 'Making the Medieval relevant' in which they stated that the Medieval past informs the present in a myriad of ways.
Title of the course: Medieval Civilization: Making the Middle Ages Relevant. This course aims to do exactly that, making the Middle Ages relevant by drawing parallels between modern-day societal, economic, and cultural occurrences and the Medieval past.Rather than presenting a chronological overview of the Middle Ages, the course is set up based on weekly themes.These themes have been selected to reflect contemporary societal issues that lend themselves to a (historical) comparative analytical approach..

The Medieval Civilization: Making the Middle Ages Relevant has the following ILOs: The goal of this course is to introduce students to Medieval history and to teach them how to use the Middle Ages as a tool to reflect on societal, cultural, and socio-economic events in contemporary society. The course aims to do so by focusing on a number of themes/topics, such as:, Modern Misrepresentations of Medieval Culture 

The portrayal of Medieval culture in today's society is often riddled with misunderstandings and inaccuracies. While the Middle Ages may be perceived as a time of darkness, ignorance, and brutality,, The 'White' Middle Ages., Modern reflections on medieval pandemics, Revolts and political order in the Middle Ages., Minorities and persecution in the Middle Ages.. 
Title of the course: Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices. Digitalization has a profound impact on our society.We can observe changes in different areas.What digital media do, what they look like, and how they relate to each other and to older media is not identical worldwide, but dependent on local practices as well.Transformations are not unequivocal.On the one hand, new genres have emerged, such as streaming channels, providing engaging forms of entertainment and learning, but also provoking vehement discussions about their impact.New possibilities, such as participation in our digital cultures, arise, but also new inequalities, as the access and competencies needed for participation are not evenly distributed, and the platforms that allow for participation also harbor new mechanisms of control and surveillance.The pace and diversity of these developments ask for continuous investigation and reflection.
Title of the course: Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices. This development has gained a new impetus through the proliferation and popularity of social media, but also the discourses around the Blockchain recently.The aim of this course is to investigate the consequences of these developments for society and culture.These consequences have been differently evaluated.The optimistic account stresses the new media’s inherent possibilities for active cultural and social participation and digital citizenship beyond the reach of existing political or commercial institutions.Authors (e.g., Marres, 2017; Fuchs, 2014; Jordan, 2015) acknowledge that participation is not evenly distributed; they also see the democratic possibilities of participation culture, stressing its empowering potential.At the same time, these authors share a less optimistic view and approach those changes more critically.
Title of the course: Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices. There are still huge differences when it comes to access to digital media, which reinforces existing inequalities related to class, race, gender, age, and geographical location.Moreover, among those who have access, there is a participation gap between people with different degrees of mastery of the cultural protocols and practices of the media involved, differentiating between the so-called interacting (those who are able to select their multidirectional circuits of communication) and the interacted (those who are provided with a restricted number of pre-packaged choices) (Castells, 2000 [1996], p.402).Others emphasize that ‘interaction’ or ‘participation’ not necessarily means power-sharing or taking control.
Title of the course: Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices. Rather than being potentially subversive, participatory practices contribute to a more fluid assimilation of users into the online economy and the penetration of everyday private and social life by the logic and power relations of capitalism.The critical angle of participation is compromised: precisely because of the interactivity, diversification, and flexibility of the new media, the networked integration of multiple communication modes enhances the absorption of all forms of cultural expression into the same symbolic environment in which the distinctions between different types of contents and codes are blurred and adapted to a pervasive cultural logic in which entertainment value is predominant.
Title of the course: Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices. Moreover, previously bottom-up developed platforms are increasingly incorporated by existing media and information companies and provide profitable resources – in the form of user data – for online businesses (van Dijck, 2013; Jordan, 2015).The recent development of Blockchain technology is ingrained into a libertarian ideology with the goal to give power and control back to the people.The discourse surrounding the Blockchain is again one of liberation and participation.The course will finish with a discussion of ethical questions related to techno-moral changes in our digital cultures.This course is labeled as a humanities course, but the discussion will include literature from qualitative social science research as well..

The Digital Media: Digitalization, Digital Cultures and User Practices has the following ILOs: The aim of this course is to familiarize students with topics relevant to digital culture and society, such as:, Introduction to the field of digital media from the perspective of the humanities and qualitative social sciences., Introduction to transformations we experience with respect to the use of media and technology (e.g., net activism, self-tracking, gamification, AI and robotics but also digital literature and art), Overview of different media platforms and user practices 

In today's digital age, there are a plethora of media platforms available for people to consume and engage with content. From social media networks to streaming platforms, each platform offers unique features and user practices.

Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram,, The relation between technological development, techno-moral change and user practices, such as blockchain, self-tracking, AI and robotics., Relevant topics related to digitization such as ethics, surveillance, and privacy will be discussed.. 
Title of the course: Media and Technology; Philosophical Perspectives. Discussions about the changes media and technology bring to culture, and whether these are to be judged good or bad, are as old as philosophy itself.Examining the ideas of Plato, Marx, Heidegger, and other philosophers, we will see how these debates have evolved over the centuries.With the development and spread of media and technology in the 20th and 21st century, debates about the relationship between the social and the technical have intensified, and so it has become necessary to consider a variety of approaches to this relationship.In this course, we will concentrate on a number of philosophical approaches that help us understand the relationship between media and technology and our lived experience.We will discuss media theory and assess whether specific technologies and media, like writing and print, provoke structural changes in patterns of thought, action, and experience.
Title of the course: Media and Technology; Philosophical Perspectives. We will also delve into the critical philosophies of technology in the Marxist tradition, the hermeneutic tradition, and the feminist tradition, as well as contemporary debates about ethics, labor, and the environment.These topics encourage us to think about how, to paraphrase the historian Melvin Kranzberg, media and technology are neither good nor bad, nor are they neutral.Across these philosophical approaches, we will also consider a variety of different media and technical artifacts, including AI, healthcare technologies, books, social media, the alphabet, and education..

The Media and Technology; Philosophical Perspectives has the following ILOs: To introduce students to a number of central themes in the philosophy of media and technology., To investigate what is at stake in different philosophical methodologies and approaches to media and technology.. 
Title of the course: Cultural Studies II: Visual Cultures. This course will explore the variety of visual cultures and the theoretical insights garnered by the study of this interdisciplinary field.Straddling cultural studies, art history, museum studies, media studies, performance studies, literary studies, and science and technology studies, the field of visual culture, at its most expansive, combines theories and methods from across the academy.We will investigate visual cultures from these exciting and challenging (interdisciplinary) perspectives.The course presents visual culture as a ubiquitous facet of modern life that, perhaps more than any other component, shapes and informs our understanding of self, society, and the world.Hence, it demands our careful attention and critical parsing of its workings at all levels of daily life.
Title of the course: Cultural Studies II: Visual Cultures. Our foray into the field will include examining the benefits of this inclusive mode of analysis, for instance, in the range of objects available for study, as well as the drawbacks, particularly in terms of methodological rigor and the overinvestment in ocularcentric forms of knowledge.The student will be invited to scrutinize their disciplinary assumptions, to develop their toolbox of concepts, and to analyze visual objects that are rarely considered inside the university.Starting with an introduction to visual culture, we’ll investigate the terms vision, visuality, and image in conjunction with varying conceptualizations of culture.Each subsequent unit will deal with a "site" of visual culture that offers an object of study, a theoretical problem, and an interdisciplinary opportunity.
Title of the course: Cultural Studies II: Visual Cultures. We will study visual cultures from high to low, and examine how these forms are quickly transforming and breaking barriers of category and genre.The principal sites of inquiry traverse fashion, gaming, museum exhibitions, medical imaging, comics, and cinema..

The Cultural Studies II: Visual Cultures has the following ILOs: To understand the way in which visual culture is conceptualized in relation to its disciplinary, historical, and theoretical contexts., To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different theories of visual culture., To select the appropriate theory(ies) and methodological tool(s) for analysis that best suit the material and argument., To communicate the way in which different approaches to visual culture mobilize disciplinary points of view using specialized terms., To demonstrate awareness of the larger social, political, and sexual issues involved in the academic study of visual culture as it relates to the body/subjectivity., To recognize the interdisciplinary nature of visual culture, its historical and contemporary overlap with scientific, artistic, and economic imaginaries.. 
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 1: Living in a Technological Culture. "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." These words of Albert Einstein are more valid today than ever.The complexities of today's societies and the relationships between them are manifold and not easy to handle.Einstein's plea to look at them in a different way is exactly what this course is about.The course aims to change your perspective on the world, so that you find that ‘the stuff of the world' can be thought about in new ways that offer opportunities for interventions and passageways for improvement.After all, making a difference requires more than decisiveness: it requires thinking in new ways, thinking 'out of the box'.And that is exactly what this course aims to do by introducing you to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS).In the field of STS, science and technology are considered as a socio-cultural phenomenon.
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 1: Living in a Technological Culture. You will be introduced to STS in two courses.In this course (this one) we will focus on the interrelation between technology and society, while in period 2 (HUM3049: Science, Power, and the Construction of Facts), we take the next step and zoom in on the constitution and application of science and its relations with society.This implies that in both cases, we will pay attention to the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic conditions that impact the development and application of science and technology.In this first course, we unpack ‘technology'.In the standard perspective, technology is largely seen as a process of applied science that simply results from previous scientific advances.In our daily routines, we also tend not to spend much thought on the making of science and technology, commonly do not merit its use serious reflection either.
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 1: Living in a Technological Culture. Once things have been made or discovered, our interaction with them is understood to be a straightforward matter.We pick up our mobile phone, make some funny pictures with it, listen to music, twitter some details about what we do and where we are, and chat with our friends.We board an airplane, fly from point A to point B, and then we get off the airplane.Although we are surrounded by the results of scientific endeavor and technologies of various kinds, they have become almost invisible, and we take them for granted.The field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) challenges this perspective on science and technology.We live in a technological culture.Technology and science shape society, from the shaping of mobility patterns, gender and sexual identities to the standardization of practices in health care.
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 1: Living in a Technological Culture. Mobile phones have changed what it means ‘to be alone'; organ transplantation has redefined our understanding of life; and AI is changing our ways of being creative.Thus, technologies do not merely assist us in our everyday lives; they are also powerful forces acting to reshape our activities and their meanings.There is, vice versa, a cultural influence on technology too.Therefore, it is important for understanding technology to acknowledge their socio-cultural base.Historical and comparative studies have shown how different socio-cultural circumstances yield very different forms and contents of science and technology.Science and technology are, finally, also cultures themselves..

The Science and Technology Studies 1: Living in a Technological Culture has the following ILOs: To provide an introduction to the social studies of science, society, and technology., To provide a basis for critical reflection on our high-tech society., To provide different perspectives on the relationship between society, science, and technology., This course will introduce you to the Science and Technology Studies (STS) framework and lay the foundation for new insights. To teach you the STS perspective, we will unpack technologies such as human enhancement technologies and the impact of the convergence of nano-, bio-, ICT, and cognitive sciences. We will also discuss everyday technologies, such as park benches, refrigerators, electric shavers, and bicycles, as well as recent developments in AI, such as Big Data and ChatGPT. In addition to focusing on the multiple ways in which technology, individuals, and institutions mutually shape one another to the benefit and sometimes detriment of society, we will also pay attention to the political and moral dimensions of technologies.. 
Title of the course: The Future of Literature?. Nobody can accurately predict the future of literature, or any aspect of the future for that matter.Nevertheless, it is possible to examine new advancements in literature that are expected to be covered in future literary histories.However, this course does not focus on digital advancements, such as e-poetry, nor does it center around practices where the functions and experiences traditionally associated with literature are being transferred to other areas.Instead, the goal of this course is to analyze the work of young writers who initially appear to engage with genres commonly associated with established literary practices and institutions.
Title of the course: The Future of Literature?. Additionally, these young writers not only tackle the significant issues and concerns of our society, such as racial inequality, class and gender disparities, climate change, the rights of migrants and refugees, LGBTQ+ discrimination, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and political violence, but these topics actually form the core of their work.A closer examination reveals that these young writers also challenge the conventional boundaries between genres.For instance, many of them disregard the binary distinction between form and content, which has often been determined along racial lines.Typically, the work of writers of color is more appreciated for its political activism rather than for its experimental approach to form.However, Claudia Rankine stands out as she skillfully combines poetry, essays, and visual art to explore the subject of race through different literary forms.
Title of the course: The Future of Literature?. Rankine is an illustrious representative of the hybrid genre known as the lyric essay.The course will also delve into other genre advancements, including autofiction, spoken word, and relational theater..

The The Future of Literature? has the following ILOs: The course is geared towards achieving the following objectives:, To provide an overview of the most important functions attributed to modern literature., To acquaint the students with relevant literary traditions and genres., To trace closely connected new developments in contemporary literature., To develop an individual case study on new developments.. 
Title of the course: Philosophical Ethics. In this course, we will be exploring the field of philosophical ethics.Our focus will be on studying the grand narratives in ethics, including the three leading normative ethical approaches: virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and utilitarianism.Throughout the course, we will engage with original texts written by thinkers from various traditions of philosophy, spanning ancient philosophy, Christian philosophy, modern philosophy, and postmodern philosophy.We will delve into topics such as Aristotelian virtue ethics, Stoic wisdom, the Christianized life as taught by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, utilitarianism as proposed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, Friedrich Nietzsche's 'grand style,' Carol Gilligan and her ethics of care, Hans Jonas and his ethics for the technological age, and Hannah Arendt's exploration of the 'banality of evil.
Title of the course: Philosophical Ethics. '

An important challenge for us will be interpreting these texts, particularly those that are not contemporary, from the perspective of the authors and their intended audience.It is crucial to avoid the pitfall of reading and interpreting these texts solely through our own lens.We highly encourage you to explore texts in their original language whenever possible, such as with Kant and Nietzsche.Additionally, we invite you to explore the similarities and differences between the texts, concepts, and authors, further enriching our understanding of philosophical ethics..

The Philosophical Ethics has the following ILOs: To explore the most important ethical approaches and to gain an increased understanding of essential philosophical concepts, theories, and authors., To study primary texts of ethics written by the most eminent philosophers of the past millennium., To evaluate and discuss cases through the lens of different ethical perspectives., To compare and contrast different philosophical concepts, theories, and authors. 
Title of the course: Back to the Philosophers Themselves!. How can an absurd novel like Voltaire’s Candide (1759) be understood as ‘philosophy’? Why did Plato present Socrates and his friends in an elaborate dialogue on love during a fancy dinner instead of just explaining his theories in an orderly written argument? And why can philosophical texts be written quite systematically and be personal (Descartes) as well as in the form of seemingly associative notes and comments (as in Wittgenstein’s famous Philosophical Investigations)? In this course, well-known philosophical texts will be read and analyzed in detail.Students will be confronted directly with the specific, often personal style of a philosopher - that will be completely different from the week before.
Title of the course: Back to the Philosophers Themselves!. While the course presents a range of philosophers who considerably differ in time period, background, and philosophical current, what binds them is their careful attention to style, and how their way of presenting their message is intricately bound up with their philosophical outlook.Reading philosophers, that is, the reading of some of their primary texts, is not only a pleasure in itself: most of the more interesting philosophers are also famous stylists.Therefore, it is important to read the original texts instead of always relying on handbooks or (internet) encyclopedia texts to acquaint oneself with the central ideas of these philosophers.
Title of the course: Back to the Philosophers Themselves!. Moreover, there is a lot to learn from reading philosophers themselves, to see how they are positioned in the tradition of philosophy and in the contemporary intellectual debate, to determine what interesting problems are, and how one could go about searching for some answers, solutions, or new questions for our time.Reading philosophers themselves also has merit for another reason: it turns out that philosophers use a variety of writing styles and publication media like a scientific treatise, a monograph, an essay, a collection of aphorisms, or even a novel.
Title of the course: Back to the Philosophers Themselves!. And last but not least: they provide the best introduction into some of the classical philosophical problems like: What can we know? How should we value? What is justice? Is there something like moral sense? Are we free? How does language work? Who is (not) included or excluded? In this course, we take the time to collectively read and profoundly discuss original texts of Plato, Descartes, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein, and Irigaray.They are responsible for some of the best work that has been produced in the philosophical tradition..

The Back to the Philosophers Themselves! has the following ILOs: To study diverse and challenging philosophical texts, while avoiding PBL's usual fragmentary reading., To immerse oneself in the primary texts of important philosophers and derive intellectual pleasure from it., To introduce some classical philosophical problems., To become aware of different styles, text forms, and sorts of philosophy.. 
Title of the course: Cultural Memory and the Politics of Visualizing the Past. In the course "Cultural memory and the politics of visualizing the past," students will learn to become aware of how what is considered 'past' has been filtered through structures of power.Which voices, sources, events, and people are remembered, and which are lost to oblivion, is a highly political question.We will explore how aesthetic and artistic narrations of history speak to counter-archives of memory, including the afterlife of slavery, embodied trauma, and legacies of crisis such as with AIDS.Our interest will be in reading along with scholars who have developed methods for grasping deposits of marginalized lived experience through listening to images (Campt), contrapuntal reading (Said), unlearning imperialism (Azoulay), wake work (Sharpe), reading queer ephemera (Muñoz), and distilling structures of feeling (Williams) such as feeling brown and down, queer and backward.
Title of the course: Cultural Memory and the Politics of Visualizing the Past. We will apply these alternative methods for historical analysis to cases of diary writing, poetry, performance, painting, music, photography, and scraps of archival records.Some of the examples of cultural memory work we will encounter include:

The Cultural Memory and the Politics of Visualizing the Past has the following ILOs: To familiarize students with theoretical approaches and methodological components within cultural memory studies concerned with minoritarian groups and affect/emotion: e.g. Nora, Stoler, Rigney, Trouillot, Said, Azoulay, Sharpe, Hartman, Muñoz, Mbembe, Campt, and Arondekar., To provide students with an introduction to archives theory and memory, especially in relation to power., To introduce students to the political and academic assessment of the post-colonial dimension of cultural memory, and the queer dimension of historical scholarship., To introduce students to alternative concepts and methods of historical analysis and to become competent in applying them to a range of cultural and archival materials., To enable students to identify and analyze the role of race, sexuality, gender, and ability in constructions of cultural remembrance (related to imperialism, heterosexism, cisgenderism, ableism)., To analyze debates connected to contested memorial monuments, literature, and the arts.. 
Title of the course: Religion, Myth and Secularization. The course provides a broad approach to religion as a cultural phenomenon.It focuses on the following groups of questions and topics:

1.On defining religion:
- What is religion about?
- How does religion differ from mythology, the sciences, and the arts?
- What do secularization processes involve?
In this part of the course, we will look into some significant philosophical perspectives on the nature of religion and secularism.2.On the contents of religion:
First, we will briefly consider the most important characteristics of the major world religions.Against this background, we will discuss a number of key narratives and themes from the Judaeo-Christian heritage, taken from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (such as the creation story, book of Job, death and resurrection of Christ, epistles by Paul).3.
Title of the course: Religion, Myth and Secularization. On the politics of religion:
In the last part of the course, we will look at the role of religion and religious institutions within political power structures, ranging from the Vatican to the Middle-East..

The Religion, Myth and Secularization has the following ILOs: To familiarize you with the academic study of religion as a cultural phenomenon against the background of a secularizing world., To provide insight into key ideas, themes, and arguments on the nature, function, and politics of religion.. 
Title of the course: History of Contemporary Spirituality. This course delves into the socio-historical contexts of non-institutionalized belief systems at the intercultural and interdisciplinary crossroads of "eastern" and "western" religious, philosophical, psychological, and scientific discourses in modern western cultures.It looks at alternative beliefs and practices of Asian and Euro-American charismatic leaders and new religious movements — popularly referred to as "spiritual teachers" or "gurus" and "cults" — in Western Europe and North America, after 1800.Think of American Transcendentalism, Theosophy, Neo-Hinduism, Neo-Buddhism, Transpersonal Psychology, as well as New Age movements and their offshoots.Students will critically reflect on alternative quests for meaning outside conventional religions and sciences.
Title of the course: History of Contemporary Spirituality. In doing so, they will learn more about post-Enlightenment responses to the "age of reason," post-colonial encounters between "eastern" and "western" traditions, and (meta) modern blends of methods and theories from different social and academic domains, which have culminated in a growing "cultic milieu" of "seekers" across contemporary western cultures.Seekers are people who identify as "spiritual, but not religious." During this course, students engage questions such as: Why have so many seekers in modern western cultures turned away from conventional western religions and sciences? Why are they turning to eastern and western esoteric traditions instead? How are they combining eastern and western methods and theories into new sources of meaning? What combinations have we seen in the recent past, and which ones do we see around today?.

The History of Contemporary Spirituality has the following ILOs: Identify social and (inter)cultural patterns and developments in the history of contemporary spirituality., Identify entanglements of "secular" and "religious" discourses in the history of contemporary spirituality., Explain how such intercultural and interdisciplinary developments have shaped contemporary spiritual beliefs and practices?, Critically reflect on popular and academic perceptions of contemporary spiritual beliefs and practices, including your own., Apply methods and theories from the course to a case study that reflects contemporary spirituality.. 
Title of the course: Data Analysis and Visualisation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. Research data in the humanities and social sciences can take many forms.It is frequently rich and complex, filled with uncertainties and difficulties in its encoding, analysis, and structure.The amount of data we have to deal with today can be overwhelming, both for research and in our personal lives.Harnessing the power of large data stores for research in the humanities and social sciences is a core objective of this course.To utilize tens, hundreds, or even thousands of texts, we would not expect you to read as you typically do for your studies (e.g., via close reading, one word, one paragraph, one page after the other) but rather read digitally.Digital 'reading' of texts goes by many names, including data analysis, text analysis, text mining, and data mining.
Title of the course: Data Analysis and Visualisation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. In this class, we are going to focus on the first of these methods, data analysis, an algorithmic-driven method of extracting text from (large) corpora.In this course, we will focus on literary and historical sources, as well as social media.The data analysis tools we will introduce you to will visualize the text, making it easier to see patterns and come to insights, and develop research questions, in minutes or hours, where previously this might have taken days, months, or years.We will explore these methods and practices through distant reading, a recent concept used to theorize the practice of reading algorithmically.This course will take you through a mini big data project to provide you with hands-on experience and understanding of the affordances and limitations of data analysis methods.No background in the methods or programming skills is needed.
Title of the course: Data Analysis and Visualisation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. We will be using easy-to-learn web-based tools and software.Theoretically, we will explore how the representation of text in more visual formats, which are typically removed from its semantic contexts, offers opportunities for both new insights as well as misrepresentation.Concepts to be covered include distant reading, algorithmic visualization, and data feminism.An overarching goal of the course is to help you become more savvy users of digital information: the implications and challenges that methods and technologies pose to conventional research, analysis, and publication in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, including issues such as transparency, authenticity, and bias..

The Data Analysis and Visualisation for the Humanities and Social Sciences has the following ILOs: Explore different methodological approaches to computationally analyze textual corpora;, Use text analysis to develop and respond to research hypotheses and questions;, Understand how to analyze text (non-semantically) through visualizations;, Critically reflect on the challenges researchers face when working with textual data through new concepts, such as distant reading and data feminism.. 
Title of the course: Poetry, Poetry Theory and Poetry Practices. Poetry usually falls under the general heading of literature.Literature, however, is a relatively recent concept as well as a recent cultural institution.It seems that one of the main goals of poetry theory in the last centuries has been to give poetry a firm literary profile.When we look at western modern poetry and its reception, this goal has certainly been reached.To a great extent, poetry has become words-on-the-page in this western modern tradition.However, some critics and scholars argue that this traditional mode of poetry, focused on the printed page and dominated by white male poets, is in serious decline.They believe that a new mode of poetry, Spoken Word, led by poets of color and aimed at a younger audience, will inevitably take over, and perhaps it has already done so.In the course "The Future of Literature? HUM2047," we will study Spoken Word as a new mode of poetry.
Title of the course: Poetry, Poetry Theory and Poetry Practices. Alongside this, we will also study the still vital tradition of 'page poetry' and the often neglected role of women poets in this field.It is important to note that not only white women poets but also women poets of color have written their poetry in this traditional mode, and they continue to do so.Even more importantly, they have often transformed it.Here are some women poets whom we will read and study in this course: Emily Dickinson, Edna St.Vincent Millay, Maya Angelou, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, and Louise Glück.Students are encouraged to choose women poets of their first language for their mini-essays and final essay..

The Poetry, Poetry Theory and Poetry Practices has the following ILOs: To acquaint the students with the theory and practice of modern Western poetry., To identify mechanisms of exclusion in the history of poetry., To provide students with tools for analyzing poetry., To develop an individual case study on women poets.. 
Title of the course: Philosophers of the 20th Century. The course reconstructs the main ideas of some of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century: Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), Michel Foucault (1926-1984), Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), and Jürgen Habermas (1929).Their ideas are partially the result of the practical turn within philosophy initiated in the 19th century by Karl Marx (1818-1883), Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), and Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914).So, elaborating on their work during the past century, many philosophers took practical issues as the starting point of their philosophy.This course tries to figure out what these practical issues are and how they are related to their theoretical ideas.Moreover, the course addresses the link between the work of these philosophers and the societal context and discusses its heuristic value..

The Philosophers of the 20th Century has the following ILOs: To introduce students to influential philosophers of twentieth-century philosophy.. 
Title of the course: Totalitarian Temptation. This course in historical studies explores the discussions and debates surrounding the much-contested concept of totalitarianism.The course will explore and compare movements and regimes, such as National Socialism, Fascism, and Soviet communism, that aimed to radically transform societies and aspired to rule in a totalizing manner.We will examine their histories in relation to mass violence and human rights.Additionally, we will discuss cultural life under these regimes, as well as their aftermath and collective memory.By drawing on intellectual history, cultural and literary studies, as well as legal studies, this course will address relevant philosophical concerns, particularly questions in epistemology and ethics.The course will conclude with analyses of contemporary discussions on the supposed fascist revival and an ongoing case of genocide..

The Totalitarian Temptation has the following ILOs: To introduce students to major theories on totalitarianism and their aftermath, and familiarize them with academic discussions and debates on the applicability of this concept to various 20th-century movements, regimes, and instances of mass violence.. 
Title of the course: Literature, Art and Psychology. In the first part of the course, students will become familiar with the basic elements of psychoanalysis (Freud) and analytical psychology (Jung).Special attention will be paid to depth psychological theories on art and literature.In the second part, we shall read a number of widely diverging depth psychological interpretations of literary texts, such as Sophocles's Oedipus Rex, Saint-Exupéry's Le Petit Prince, Goncharov's Oblomov, Hoffmann's The Sandman, Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, several fairy tales, myths, poems, and short stories.The last part of the course is devoted to some epistemological aspects of depth psychological literary criticism.
Title of the course: Literature, Art and Psychology. We will go into three main questions: What types of rules are to be observed when interpreting literary texts? To what extent does depth psychological literary criticism qualify as an academic discipline? And, finally, to what extent do depth psychological theories like psychoanalysis and analytical psychology qualify as academic disciplines?.

The Literature, Art and Psychology has the following ILOs: To introduce you to depth psychological (i.e. Freudian and Jungian) literary criticism., To help you develop your sensitivity to the depth psychological dimensions that works of art and literature may have., To provide you with the means to distinguish adequate literary interpretations from less adequate ones, on what reasonable grounds, if any, can we decide that one (depth psychological) interpretation of a work of literature does more justice to the text than a competing one?. 
Title of the course: World History. Flowing from this objective, the course deals with the overall history of mankind and a number of the decisive transformations involved in that history.What sort of creatures are we? How have we evolved from and lived before we became Homo sapiens? What sort of animals are our ancestors? Important topics nearer in time are the agricultural and industrial revolutions.The agricultural or Neolithic revolution has changed us and the world permanently.In a relatively brief period, we went from hunting and gathering to tilling the soil and domesticating plants and animals.Why and how did we do this? Since the agricultural revolution, our numbers have multiplied beyond comprehension.Societies became increasingly complex and stratified.The industrial revolution lifted everything to a new unprecedented plane.A type of society arose, driven by industrial innovation and run on fossil fuels.
Title of the course: World History. We are still living in that kind of society today, so it is interesting to know how it came about.The course will also deal with topics like the role of war, disease, religion, worldviews, and finance in shaping history.Take disease.Their ways of life brought men in contact with all sorts of diseases.Especially after the agricultural revolution, we had to adapt to diseases we caught from our domesticated animals.We still have to do this.Look at present-day threats like bird flu.Living in some form of armed peace with diseases has always been a major characteristic of societies.How did we do this? We will end the course by looking into the harnessing of energy and the necessary limits to that in the various societal arrangements, such as hunter-gatherers, farmers, and fossil-fuelers like us..

The World History has the following ILOs: To understand some of the major issues and episodes that have shaped the history of mankind, the focus will be on themes and topics that have had or are still having long-term influences on historical development.. 
Title of the course: Narrative Media. The first part of the course introduces the main concepts from narratology, such as story, discourse, focalization, and narration.Additionally, students will learn the differences between a structuralist and a postclassical approach to narratology.During the second part of the course, the subject of investigation will be narrativity in different media.We will explore how different media construct stories and to what extent these stories are medium-specific.The media that will be studied include the short story, the fixed image and series of images, comics, film, hyperfiction, and digital games.For students with a particular interest in literature, the Handbook of Narrative Analysis (2005) will be most instructive, while Narrative across Media will be most useful to students who are more oriented towards other media.Throughout this course, we will read chapters from both books as well as other literature that addresses the narrativity of media.
Title of the course: Narrative Media. The final essay must demonstrate that students are able to apply the methods introduced during the course to a case study of their choice.Some examples of possible case studies include the novel House of Leaves, the short story collection Olive Kitteridge, the comic Deadpool and its film adaptation, the graphic novel Persepolis, the film 5x2, and the game L.A.Noire.However, as this is a course in the humanities, an approach to storytelling from the social sciences or psychology is only possible in comparison to methods from the humanities..

The Narrative Media has the following ILOs: To familiarize students with the methods of narratology (the study of storytelling) and important theories revolving around narratology., To analyze different media such as literature, paintings, photographs, comics, film, digital literature, and computer games.. 
Title of the course: Crucial Differences in the 21st Century. This course considers a variety of contemporary configurations of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, age, religion, and other categories of difference.You will learn to examine the way in which these ‘crucial differences’ are constituted in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, as well as to analyze the ways in which they function on social, cultural, political, and symbolic levels.The emergence of various social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the women’s movement, the civil rights movement, and gay and lesbian liberation, and their lasting impact on society today, serves as a starting point for the course.We will examine how these diverse movements have shaped and reshaped the form and content of the identity of racial/ethnic minorities, feminists, LGBTQ+ people, and other minoritized groups on individual and collective levels.
Title of the course: Crucial Differences in the 21st Century. Special attention will be directed to the notion of intersectionality, which refers to the interaction between multiple categories of difference in cultural, social, and individual practices, and the effects of these interactions in terms of power and inequality.Subsequently, we will take a closer look at the complexity of such multiple differences and inequalities by tracing the entangled workings of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, class, age, and religion through a variety of topical cases.We will look at the way in which such categories realign in various contexts of crisis and conflict, ranging from the late twentieth-century wars in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to the complex force-fields of (neo-)nationalism, populism, and xenophobia today.
Title of the course: Crucial Differences in the 21st Century. We will use a queer theoretical approach to analyze the complex relations between norms of gender and sexuality in the structuring of contemporary performances of identity in a variety of social, cultural, and institutional environments.We will critically examine contemporary constructions of whiteness and the role of race in the construction of national identity.We will direct special attention to the emergence of sexual nationalisms across and beyond Europe today, focusing on the prominent place that women’s sexual liberation and gay rights occupy in contemporary debates about Islam and multicultural citizenship.As these cases indicate, the course draws on a variety of geographical and cultural locations and contexts.Diversity is also exemplified in the interdisciplinarity that characterizes gender and diversity studies as a scholarly field.
Title of the course: Crucial Differences in the 21st Century. The texts used in this course draw on theories and methods from disciplines such as philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies, as well as from the fields of feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and queer studies.Through critical inquiry into concrete cases as well as major texts - including modern classics in the field such as Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble and Joan Scott’s The Politics of the Veil - this course dynamically reconceptualizes the intersections between the various ‘crucial differences’ by examining the multiple ways in which processes of identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality are produced and reproduced in ongoing flows of negotiation and transformation..

The Crucial Differences in the 21st Century has the following ILOs: To examine how contemporary configurations of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and other crucial differences structure contemporary cultural discourses and practices, as well as social and individual identities and institutions., To identify and participate in topical academic and societal debates within contemporary gender and diversity studies., To explain how multiple identities and experiences of difference and inequality interact, we adopt intersectionality as a critical theory and method., To apply the analytical and critical skills needed to examine the dynamics through which identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality are continuously produced and reproduced., To construct an effective research design for an undergraduate research paper within the field of gender and diversity studies,. 
Title of the course: Biopoetics: An Evolutionary Approach to Art, Literature, Music and Religion. Students will familiarize themselves with the basic concepts of evolutionary theory in order to be able to evaluate the controversies and debates within the framework of a Darwinist perspective on practices in art, literature, music, and religion.Several themes will be discussed, such as the mating mind, artistic universals, human nature (blank or pre-wired), the sound and rhythm of poetry, the science of art, the origins of music, grooming, gossip, and the novel, art as adaptation vs.art as 'cheesecake' for the mind, and rituals in religion, etc..

The Biopoetics: An Evolutionary Approach to Art, Literature, Music and Religion has the following ILOs: To be able to evaluate and apply Darwinian approaches to practices in art, literature, music, and religion.. 
Title of the course: Acts of Literature: The Role of prose, Poetry and Plays in a Changing World.
Title of the course: Acts of Literature: The Role of prose, Poetry and Plays in a Changing World. As stated in Eleonora Belfiore's and Oliver Bennett's The social impact of the arts: An intellectual history (2008), the question of what the function of literature could be - or should be - produced from Aristotle on many answers that could roughly be grouped under the following overarching concepts: catharsis (emotional, didactical, or intellectual), personal well-being (literature as therapy, play, or experience), education and self-development (basically the humanist's view of literature as, in Stephen Spender's words, 'central medium for the realization of man's search for significance in life'), moral improvement and civilization (French Enlightenment, Kant, Martha Nussbaum), political instrument (Brecht, social realism, Nazi and fascist literature, feminist, postcolonial, and minority literature, often also in the sense of the unmasking of literature as vehicles for accepting hierarchies in society: Orwell, Foucault, Said, Judith Butler, the Frankfurt School), social stratification (Weber, Simmel, Bourdieu), and the rejection of any of these functions (Kant again, l'art pour l'art).
Title of the course: Acts of Literature: The Role of prose, Poetry and Plays in a Changing World. However, the starting point of the course is the notion that literature exists only in the readings given to it: literature has no existence outside these readings.The work of literature is an event or, from the reader's position, an experience, both set in a particular culture that is made up by habits, norms, values, representations, beliefs, expectations, and prejudices.With the recent merging of literature's functions of education and moral improvement in mind (e.g.for the benefit of democracy, see Martha Nussbaum's work), the main challenge of the course is trying to find out in what way the ethical and political demand made by a literary work is to be found in what makes it literature, as an event and as an experience, rather than in properties it shares with other discourses, such as historical writing, biographies, and journalistic work.
Title of the course: Acts of Literature: The Role of prose, Poetry and Plays in a Changing World. In other words: what is it that makes acts of literature in society literary acts?.

The Acts of Literature: The Role of prose, Poetry and Plays in a Changing World has the following ILOs: To provide students with a solid understanding of the subject matter., To develop students' skills and abilities in the field, To familiarize the students with the history of ideas on the possible functions of literature., To familiarize students with the notion of literature as a work that is both an event and an experience., To introduce students to periods of societal change in Western and non-Western societies and the role literature played in it., To provide students with analytical tools for contextualizing (historical, situational, comparative) the case studies in the course., To teach students how to present their own case studies as potential contributions to next year's course edition.. 
Title of the course: Philosophy of Language. The philosophy of language is concerned with the role that language plays in thinking, specifically in regards to knowledge.It is closely related to epistemology and philosophic theories on truth.However, the role of language also becomes essential when transitioning from judgments about the world to moral judgments, which express how we should act within that world.In this course, we will explore how the study of language has been the main interest of philosophers throughout history.Additionally, we will discuss how a philosopher's interpretation of the function of language is connected to their overall worldview.We will pay specific attention to philosophers such as Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, but we will also touch on the works of other philosophers including William of Ockham, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.The course will delve into the fundamental properties of language that make it a medium of thought and knowledge.
Title of the course: Philosophy of Language. These properties include truth, meaning, and reference, which are closely intertwined in what is often called the "triangle of language." Developing the ability to think philosophically about language will have a broader impact beyond philosophical topics.It will enhance your critical thinking skills, better equipping you to make important decisions and making you less susceptible to manipulation by others..

The Philosophy of Language has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the history of philosophical thought concerning language, including the implications of several important theories about language for how we think about knowledge and the possibility of making judgments.. 
Title of the course: Distributive Justice in Contemporary Political Philosophy. Distributive Justice concerns the morally correct way of distributing the burdens and benefits of social cooperation among citizens.In the wake of the publication of John Rawls’s monumental A Theory of Justice, there has been an explosion of political philosophizing about this issue, one that continues to this day.This course will examine the work of some of today’s most prominent political philosophers working in the field of justice.In doing so, we will study several topics that are related to some of the issues discussed in COR1004 (Political Philosophy).As such, the course is designed to be a sequel to that course, and familiarity with the concepts and authors discussed in that course is presumed.Having said that, this course is distinctive in several respects.First of all, the course will strictly focus on debates within academia, rather than hot political debates within the wider community.
Title of the course: Distributive Justice in Contemporary Political Philosophy. Secondly, the course will exclusively use original primary texts, i.e.original scientific articles and book chapters.Thirdly, the course will be particularly concerned with the construction and evaluation of the minutia of argument.We will be looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments presented for certain ethical claims and positions, with the aim of figuring out whether we agree with them, and to determine what our own conception of justice is..

The Distributive Justice in Contemporary Political Philosophy has the following ILOs: To examine some recent developments in political philosophy in the field of distributive justice., To engage with the work of today’s leading political philosophers in this field and critically evaluate their arguments., To discover one's preferred conception of justice.. 
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 2: Science, Power and Construction of Facts. Science is a system of knowledge production that constructs truths.It is a powerful institution that requires critical examination.However, there are contemporary movements of "alternative facts" and "post-truth politics".The relationship between these movements and the power of science in establishing "facts" is the focus of this course.To understand the power of science in producing "facts", we will examine the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic contexts in which science is practiced and scientific knowledge is circulated in society.This course follows up on the Living in a Technological Culture course and focuses on the production and dissemination of technoscience outputs.It examines science in action in its immediate environment and its role in society.
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 2: Science, Power and Construction of Facts. We will study the processes through which credible facts are established and published, as well as the collaborative nature of science.The integrity of science and its grey areas will also be discussed.The wider socio-economic context in which science operates, including its commercialization and the relationship between scientific promises/expectations and societal hopes/fears, will be explored.Additionally, the course will delve into the cultural-historical contexts that influence the interpretation of facts and the concept of "science" itself.We will uncover the Western identity of the dominant conceptualization of science and discuss its relation to social power structures.Through discussions and analyses of these topics, the course aims to encourage critical reflection on commonly held views of the making and use of scientific claims.
Title of the course: Science and Technology Studies 2: Science, Power and Construction of Facts. In addition to tutorial meetings, the course includes lectures, discussion meetings, video analysis, and an interview with a researcher..

The Science and Technology Studies 2: Science, Power and Construction of Facts has the following ILOs: To describe the contemporary challenges and dynamics of knowledge production in the sciences., To identify the complexities of how scientific knowledge is distributed and communicated in society,, To critically analyze 'common sense' views on the making and use of scientific claims.. 
Title of the course: A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society. If you have enjoyed courses in crucial differences, cultural studies, and identities, this course will be another eye-opener.It focuses on age as an identity marker and is set up in a true interdisciplinary fashion, encompassing perspectives from economy, history, the arts, globalization, and gender studies, amongst others.If you believe aging is far removed from your personal sphere – think twice and continue reading! Headlines everywhere tell us that ours is a graying world and that population aging will be a defining influence on our twenty-first century, radically affecting public health and national economies.
Title of the course: A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society. These demographic predictions—the result of the trends of declining mortality and increasing longevity—are typically accompanied by dire warnings of the challenges ahead: unsustainable pension systems which will encumber younger generations, the critical need for more caregivers and more resources to care for the increasing numbers of those who are frail and dependent, concerns about maintaining technological progress and competitive workforces with an aging labor force, etc.Rarely are such numbers presented in terms of the possible benefits that population aging might bring, such as experienced leadership, informal caregiving, and a more flexible labor force less hampered by child care.Also often excluded from these projections is any sense of what life is actually like for the diverse millions of people who grow into old age.
Title of the course: A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society. How do we know what these numbers will mean for our economies, our social structures, our loved ones, and ourselves? To begin to address that question, we need to understand better what it means to grow old in the twenty-first century and how this meaning may have developed or changed over the course of history or be differently shaped by national and transnational cultures.Also, it requires research into the many images and stories of aging that circulate in popular culture and influence the way we think about older people.This, then, will form the heart of the inquiry we will make in this course.We will explore what aging is and means from different disciplinary, historical, and (trans)national perspectives, examining the concerns raised about aging societies and the causes and consequences of ageism, which is prejudice or discrimination based upon a person’s age.Aging is a topic that we all have a stake in.
Title of the course: A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society. On one level, this stake is very personal.If we live the long lives we desire, we will all become older, whether or not the label “old” is one we fear or desire.On a larger scale, the concerns of population aging cross every discipline and ageism pervades all parts of our social and personal lives, even when we don’t recognize it.Whatever occupation you pursue, a deeper understanding of aging will have relevance.This course will prepare you to engage critically in the current and future debates about our aging society and to interrogate your hopes and fears for your own aging experiences.Theoretically and methodologically, this course is part of diversity studies as it adds the category of age to other identity markers, such as gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and religion..

The A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society has the following ILOs: To understand age as an identity category that intersects with other categories like gender, sexuality, disability, and ethnicity., To distinguish between multiple, disciplinarily-influenced ways of defining ‘age', including chronologically, functionally, subjectively, and culturally., To recognize ageist discourses (cf. the reduction of aging to physical and mental decline) and practices and to reflect on attitudes towards age., To distinguish between realistic concerns and the alarmist hype surrounding global population aging., To understand the different methods implemented in aging research, ranging from visual analysis to ethnographic approaches.. 
Title of the course: Medical Humanities: Bodies & Minds, Histories of the Normal and the Pathological. Medical humanities acknowledge that instead of being fixed entities, health and illness are constantly changing, ambiguous phenomena.What is called healthy (sane) or ill (insane) depends indeed on a large variety of issues and dynamics: cultural, socio-economic, and religious aspects; moral system; legal system; science; technology; art and media etc.This course approaches the question of health and illness through a philosophical, anthropological, and sociological exploration of "bodies" and "minds".Through a historical and cross-cultural perspective, it will discuss various concepts of body and mind.We will discuss how and why some bodies and minds are considered as normal and others as abnormal or pathological.For this, we will draw on scientific, social, cultural, and economic contexts, but also on how bodies and minds are represented in art and (popular) culture.
Title of the course: Medical Humanities: Bodies & Minds, Histories of the Normal and the Pathological. Cases include cosmetic surgery, the modern hospital, boxing in the ghetto, organ transplantation, depression, menopause, prostheses in Paralympic athletes, medical imaging technologies, and the war on cancer..

The Medical Humanities: Bodies & Minds, Histories of the Normal and the Pathological has the following ILOs: To gain knowledge of different influential conceptions of 'body' and 'mind', 'healthy' and 'sick', 'normal' and 'pathological', 'regular' and 'deviant'., To gain understanding of how cultural, social, economic, legal, scientific, and religious contexts play a role in the construction and consequences of these distinctions.. 
Title of the course: Lifting the Iron Curtain. Modern and Contemporary Eastern Europe. "Lifting the Iron Curtain" studies the political, social, and economic transformation of Eastern Europe from the end of the First World War to the present day.This multidisciplinary course can be divided into two major parts: a historical section dedicated to the "short twentieth century" until 1989-91 and a contemporary section that explores the achievements and shortcomings of the past three decades.The first half of the course begins by examining East-West relations in Europe on both material and discursive levels.It then delves into the emergence of the nation-state system and the rise and fall of democracy following the First World War.The course also focuses on the simultaneous rise of the Bolshevik regime in the newly formed Soviet Union, as well as its development under Lenin and Stalin.
Title of the course: Lifting the Iron Curtain. Modern and Contemporary Eastern Europe. Sessions are dedicated to the origins of Soviet-type regimes in Eastern Europe and the major challenges these regimes faced, such as the Hungarian uprising and the Prague Spring, as well as the reasons behind the unexpected and sudden collapse of these regimes in 1989-91.The second half of the course evaluates the political and economic transformation of Eastern Europe since 1989-91.Key topics include questions about democratization and the quality of democracy in the region, as well as the European opening and the associated expectations, hopes, and disappointments.The course also examines the origins and progression of the two major violent conflicts in the region: the 1990s conflict in former Yugoslavia and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Finally, the course concludes with a discussion of the major challenges that Eastern European countries currently face..

The Lifting the Iron Curtain. Modern and Contemporary Eastern Europe has the following ILOs: The course explores key developments in Eastern Europe over the past hundred years, from a comparative point of view, with a focus on communist regimes (discipline of history and field of Soviet studies). It also examines contemporary trends, such as democratization, Europeanization, economic transformations, and crises, as well as violent conflicts since 1989-91 (comparative politics and international relations, economic history, peace and conflict studies). The course aims to broaden students' horizons to a region that has been the central stage of numerous recent transformations and cataclysms in Europe. It seeks to equip students with the tools to analyze modern and contemporary Eastern Europe from a multidisciplinary perspective.. 
Title of the course: The Idea of Africa. In this comprehensive course - the title of which is taken from Valentin-Yves Mudimbe – we will deal with two questions throughout the period: 1) How have we come to know Africa and 2) To what extent can one speak of an African knowledge (Africanism), and in what sense? (Mudimbe, Invention, p.9).Course readings are predominantly based on writings that are produced either on the African continent or by African writers and/or scholars.We start out the course with an interrogation into how we imagine the continent from within and outside of Africa.Does the “single story” narrative, i.e.stereotypical representations that involve images of poverty, starvation and war, influence our imagination as outlined by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie or is our imagination more multilayered? What comes after is a historical journey into how Africans came into contact with Europeans prior to the Atlantic slave trade.
Title of the course: The Idea of Africa. Excerpts from John Thornton’s book, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World 1400 – 1800 (2012) will serve as a starting point for this.We then look into African epistemologies of knowledge to explore how African knowledge is constructed and organized.Focusing on Mudimbe’s The Invention of Africa (1988), we explore what he refers to as “African gnosis,” i.e.a term he uses to include African traditional systems of thought into what is generally denoted as African philosophy.We look into the argument in which he states that the colonizing structure has resulted in dichotomizing structures where the traditional is juxtaposed with the modern, the oral with the written, the agrarian with the urban and the subsistence economy with the highly productive economy.This, in turn, has produced marginal societies, cultures, and human beings.
Title of the course: The Idea of Africa. This task is followed by Aimeé Césaire’s Discourse on Colonialism (1950), an intense and exemplary text from the Black radical tradition written at the height of decolonization movements in Africa and at a time when Western colonial nations were losing their hold on their colonies.From this, we take a dive into examples of anticolonial resistance via sections from Saidya Hartmann’s study on the transatlantic slave route as well as Frantz Fanon’s reflections on the complexities of resistance by the Algerian population during the Algerian war.Fanon provides us with a brilliant analysis of the doctor-patient relationship and its significance to the anticolonial struggle.This is followed by exploring how movements such as Pan-Africanism and the Black Consciousness movement in South Africa have affected the African experience.
Title of the course: The Idea of Africa. Desmond Tutu’s No Future without Forgiveness (1999), a detailed and fascinating report on South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission comes after this exploration.We conclude the course by delving into contemporary political themes such as African feminism, Queer politics, questions of whiteness in Africa, and the politics of “development.”.

The The Idea of Africa has the following ILOs: To become critically reflexive about Western ideas and images of Africa and to dismantle European constructions of the African continent., The course will provide students with a first-hand experience of reading works by and learning from African scholars from within and outside of the continent.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Chemistry. The emphasis of this course will be on a number of essential topics in modern chemistry.The course will start with a close look at the structure of atoms and their place in the periodic table, followed by an examination of the properties of various types of chemical bonds, ending with a discussion of chemical reactivity.The topics covered in this course include the characteristics of gases, liquids, and solids, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, acid-base chemistry, electrochemistry, and chemical bonding theory.The concepts that are learned will be applied to biochemical examples.Basic knowledge of chemistry is important in a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from life sciences and medicine to management, economics, and governance studies..

Title of the course: The Digital Enterprise. Too often, IT is viewed as the province of technocrats, a domain inhabited by technical experts with little relevance to real-world problems.And yet, the economic importance of information, information systems, and thus information management has been growing constantly over the last decades, thanks to the relentless increase in computer performance.We are increasingly dependent on information systems and data to make decisions in a wide range of domains.Sensor and network technology help us to collect and analyze data in real-time, and to speed up decision making in all areas of our society.The possibilities of information and computer science are endless, but they also raise concerns: for instance, about privacy, security, and identity, but also about interpretation and perception of data.All these developments have led to the present-day "digital enterprise.
Title of the course: The Digital Enterprise. " In digital enterprises, the creation, distribution, use, integration, and manipulation of information is a significant economic activity.The digitization of enterprises also has consequences for society.People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens.This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.The digital society can be both a threat and an opportunity to enterprises – this is, for instance, clearly visible in sectors such as retail (traditional retailers vs.Amazon & Co), accommodation (traditional hotel vs.Airbnb), and transportation (traditional taxis vs.Uber).This course offers an overview of the role of digital concepts in enterprises: the digital enterprise.The course provides both a theoretical grounding and a pragmatic approach to applying key concepts.
Title of the course: The Digital Enterprise. Drawing on ideas, tools, and techniques from such disciplines as economics, sociology, cognitive science, organizational behavior, and computer science, the course shows the digital enterprise from different perspectives: its position in society and the market, but also elements such as governance, information technology, and people.The course serves as an introduction to other Information and Computer Science courses, in which the various topics of the Digital Enterprise will be discussed in more detail..

Title of the course: Introduction to Biology. Biology, the science of life, studies organisms as the basic units of life.It explores how they evolve, how they are built up, how they function, how they communicate with each other, how they interact with the non-living environment, and how they reproduce.Since organisms are composed of cells, which are the fundamental building blocks of life, the course will begin by examining biomolecules and the chemical reactions that sustain life.This will be followed by topics on organelles, cells, DNA, and the complex protein machinery responsible for cellular diversity.We will then delve into cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and reproduction.As we approach the end of the course, our focus will shift towards studying organ systems and the various evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to the remarkable biodiversity found on planet Earth..

The Introduction to Biology has the following ILOs: Classify the four molecules of life based on their structure and function., Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on organelles and their functions., Summarize the main pathways to generate ATP., Compare and contrast the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis., Transcribe and translate the molecules of DNA, mRNA, or the amino acid sequence if given., Describe the phases of mitosis and meiosis., Provide and use examples of homeostatic mechanisms in animal bodies.

Homeostatic mechanisms are essential for maintaining stable internal conditions in animal bodies. These mechanisms help regulate various physiological variables, such as body temperature, blood sugar levels, and pH levels. Here are a few examples of homeostatic mechanisms in animals:

1. Thermoreg, Differentiate between innate and adaptive immunity., Recognize top-down or bottom-up effects in food chains., Differentiate between homologous and analogous adaptations.

Homologous and analogous adaptations are two different types of adaptations that organisms can develop in response to their environment. While they may serve similar functions, it is important to understand the differences between these two types of adaptations.

Homologous adaptations are.

Title of the course: Sustainable Development: An Introduction. Today, it is acknowledged that achieving sustainable development at the local, regional, and global scale is one of the greatest challenges for the 21st century.But in many cases, the term 'sustainable development' functions as little more than a vacuous buzzword.So, what does sustainable development actually mean? How unsustainable is our global society at the moment? Are we contributing to irreversible climate change? Are we already passing dangerous global environmental tipping points? Why are humans acting in such unsustainable ways? And, of course, what are sustainable ways forward?

This course aims to enhance students' understanding of 'sustainable development' based on the notion that human development can only be sustainable when environmental boundaries are respected.The course introduces the main concepts, ideas, and theories related to the term sustainable development.
Title of the course: Sustainable Development: An Introduction. Students will gain insights into (the limits to) humanity's immense impact on the earth's systems and the underlying drivers of these unsustainable trends.Furthermore, sustainable development requires an understanding that inaction has consequences.Students will explore ideas about how to achieve a more sustainable society.As part of the examination, students will link theories, concepts, and ideas discussed in the course to a self-selected case study (a promising way forward towards sustainability) in a poster presentation..

The Sustainable Development: An Introduction has the following ILOs: To gain a basic understanding of the various perspectives on the concept of sustainable development and some of the main related ideas, concepts, and theories., To gain insights into the limits of our immense global human impact on the earth's systems and the underlying drivers of these unsustainable trends., To explore ideas about how to achieve a more sustainable society.. 
Title of the course: Discrete Mathematics. The students will learn what the following fundamental concepts involve: 

1.Numbers: We discuss integers, natural numbers, real numbers, and prime numbers and the properties that these classes of numbers have.2.Logic: This involves drawing correct conclusions and how to use logic to prove mathematical statements.3.Sets: A set is nothing more than a collection of items.Often those items will be numbers, but this is not necessarily the case.We discuss properties of sets and concepts related to sets, like intersections and unions.4.(Mathematical) relations: A relation is essentially a comparing mechanism for elements in a set.For example, 'smaller than'.We discuss several relations and their properties.5.Functions: A function is a mapping from one set to another.We discuss several properties that functions may have, like invertibility.6.
Title of the course: Discrete Mathematics. Combinatorics, the science of 'smart counting': The question is 'In how many ways…', the answer will often be a big number and we discuss how to find them quickly.For this purpose, we use concepts like permutations and combinations.Almost every time mathematics is used, it concerns some of the above concepts.A good understanding of these topics is therefore very important, and Discrete Mathematics is a perfect course to combine with other mathematics courses.Hence, students who are interested in (applied) mathematics, computer science, and/or econometrics might find this course particularly useful..

The Discrete Mathematics has the following ILOs: To make students familiar with several fundamental concepts in mathematics, including numbers, logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions, and combinatorics (see description)., To help students notice the beauty of the world of mathematics.. 
Title of the course: Human Physiology. While mathematics is seen as the father of science, physiology is the mother.Physiology attempts to explain the physical and chemical factors that are responsible for the origin, development, and progression of life.Human physiology investigates the mechanisms of the human body, making it a living being (Guyton).In the healthy human body, it is of the utmost importance that the working conditions for all cells are kept "constant." In this respect, it is noteworthy that essentially all organs and cells of the human body perform functions that help to maintain this constant nature or homeostasis by using feedback mechanisms.We will begin by discussing the physiology of the cell and the function of the cell membrane.
Title of the course: Human Physiology. Continuing, we will discuss cardiovascular physiology, respiratory physiology, fluid and salt balance, followed by the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system, and finally ending with gastrointestinal physiology, control, and feedback..

The Human Physiology has the following ILOs: To obtain a basic knowledge of human physiology.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Game Theory.

Title of the course: Theory Construction and Modelling Techniques. This course introduces students to theorizing and modeling.It is relevant for a wide range of other courses offered at UCM.The course aims to familiarize students with model systems within the disciplines of Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities.Modeling is essential for all research, irrespective of concentration or discipline.Models allow us to approach complex questions systematically, for instance, by predicting weather conditions, the patterns of bird flight formations, or the results of presidential elections.Such questions are present everywhere, and it is through modeling that we can try to find some answers.Modeling helps us to break down what we are studying into variables, understand relations or correlations between them, and even predict the future.The course starts with an introduction to models, followed by several case studies illustrating their usefulness in various contexts.
Title of the course: Theory Construction and Modelling Techniques. The course fosters a thorough understanding of natural, social, and cultural phenomena by exposing students to models used in academia and everyday thinking.Throughout the course, students are encouraged to apply models to specific situations and examples from their daily life.The final report allows students to use the knowledge gained in the course to analyze a case study of their interest.The lectures help students gain a broad understanding of different modeling techniques.A special workshop helps to trigger interests, thoughts, and ideas and find ways of translating them into a structured academic poster..

Title of the course: Logic. Given a list of sentences like: 

1."The next line is false"
2."The next line is true"
3."The first line is true"

Then you can use logic or logical thinking to determine which of the previous lines are true or not.As it turns out, these three sentences contradict each other, and you cannot even answer that question.Even while this is just a puzzle, similar thought processes shook the foundation of mathematics and logic in the early 19th century, through things like Russell’s paradox and Gödel’s theorem.Next to that, the development of computers and computer science opened up even more the need for a logical framework.Its on these two main topics that this course touches: the development of the foundations of mathematics and the resulting issues, as well as logical techniques of proving.It is to be expected that a student taking this course comes out with a better ability to reason logically.
Title of the course: Logic. A brief list of some of the topics covered:
- Syllogistic reasoning, mainly used for linking language to logic
- Axioms, which are the "things" you need to assume to be true without proof
- Proofs, which derive truths from axioms by logical steps.- Propositional logic: the language of logic which uses formulas like (p q)r
- Truth tables, in order to determine which formulas are true and which formulas are always true or always false
- Logical deduction: giving proofs using very clear, basic logical steps, leaving no room for discussion or error
- Paradoxes like Russell’s paradox and the Grelling-Nelson paradox.- Optional topics are, among others, "tableaus," "multivalued logic," "The axiom of choice," and "Gödel’s theorem"

The student will learn how to think rigidly and how to formulate this rigid thinking in a sound and structured way.This will prepare a student for exact thinking used in sciences as well as philosophy.
Title of the course: Logic. The basics of how to conduct mathematical (and logical) proofs is explained.The students are exposed to the concept of "axioms" and how to use them in order to derive results from them in a logical way.The course exposes students to basic mathematical proofs and lets them get a first taste of giving proofs themselves.This is elaborated further by working with the more rigorous logical proof systems mentioned above.The course is rounded off by covering Russell’s paradox, how this historically shook the foundations of science, and how it still is something that has to be taken into consideration..

Title of the course: Optimization. In everyday life, we are surrounded by applications of optimization.The common drive of human activity is to make things better, enhance performance, and carry out the best possible actions in given situations.Often, the essentials of a situation can be captured by a mathematical description (a model, with or without constraints), and the value of a proposed action by a function (an optimization criterion).The goal then becomes to optimize the criterion for the given model under the associated constraints (if any).Depending on the nature of the model, constraints, and optimization function, many different mathematical techniques are available to characterize and compute optima.In this course, we address the most important areas in optimization and study the most common techniques.First, we consider the optimization of unconstrained continuous functions in several variables.
Title of the course: Optimization. Some notions we will come across are: partial derivatives, the gradient and the Hessian, stationary points, minima, maxima, and saddle points, as well as local and global optima.Techniques to compute optima range from analytical and algebraic techniques (i.e., solving systems of equations) to iterative and approximate numerical techniques (e.g., gradient methods and hill climbing, Newton and quasi-Newton methods, and several others).We will focus on a selection of these.An important class of functions to consider is that of least squares criteria.We will consider both linear and nonlinear least squares problems and suitable iterative techniques to solve them.Linear least squares problems are often encountered in the context of fitting a model to measurement data.They also allow one to rephrase the problem of solving a nonlinear system of equations as an optimization problem, while the converse is possible too.
Title of the course: Optimization. Secondly, we address optimization problems subject to a given set of constraints.A well-known class consists of linear optimization functions subject to linear equality or inequality constraints, known as linear programs.The problem of fitting a linear model to measurement data using the criterion of least absolute deviations can be reformulated as a linear program.Several methods are available to solve such problems, including active set methods and the simple x algorithm, as well as interior point methods and primal-dual methods.We discuss the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for optimality.For the optimization of nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints, we address the Lagrange multiplier method.To demonstrate the various optimization problems and solution techniques, we will provide many examples and exercises.These examples and exercises are taken from different fields of science and engineering to demonstrate the wide range of applicability.

The Data Analytics has the following ILOs: This course aims to provide hands-on experience in analyzing managerial decision processes based on available data and using quantitative techniques for decision making.. 
Title of the course: Global Health: Impact of Flows of People, Goods, Knowledge and Technologies on Health and Disease. Globalization processes and widespread neoliberal governing principles have induced and enhanced flows of people, goods, knowledge, and technology, which go hand in hand with flows of health and disease.The increase in global wealth that neoliberal market strategies have brought is not distributed evenly across the globe.Since wealth and health are intrinsically related, the aforementioned flows create new health inequalities.Indeed, we have seen that in the past decades, in which globalization has come to full fruition, disease patterns have shifted and disease manifestations have changed.For instance, migration of people entails the spread of epigenetic predispositions to disease.Climate change causes microorganisms or vectors to spread beyond their usual habitat, facilitating the onset of diseases in regions where diseases were not endemic before.
Title of the course: Global Health: Impact of Flows of People, Goods, Knowledge and Technologies on Health and Disease. Flows of technology change local settings, with consequences for people’s health.As technological advances are not available to all, the divide between those who have access and those who do not deepens.Migrating diseases or causes of diseases challenge our understanding of disease.For instance, some familial diseases such as sickle cell disease that have spread through migration are often constructed and classified as "racial" diseases, whereas evidence shows in this case it is rather the gene-environment interaction that underlies disease manifestation.Most diseases are the result of complex interactions between genetic, biological, behavioral, social, political, economic, and cultural factors, at the intersection of which individual or population health finds itself.
Title of the course: Global Health: Impact of Flows of People, Goods, Knowledge and Technologies on Health and Disease. Examining flows of diseases, people, goods, knowledge, and technology induced by processes of globalization can deepen our understanding of the complexity of health and disease.In this course, these flows will be studied in depth, bringing insights into (epi)genetic disease distributions as well as the spread of information and technology, and migration, all of which affect health and disease.The content of this course draws on several distinct academic disciplines: political economy, anthropology, biomedicine, (epi)genetics, and epidemiology..

The Global Health: Impact of Flows of People, Goods, Knowledge and Technologies on Health and Disease has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the foundations of political economy, neoliberalism, and globalization processes and their interrelatedness with health, To provide students with insights into how epigenetic changes result from an interplay between factors of biological, environmental, behavioral, social, and political nature., To provide students with knowledge of biology, epidemiology, sociology, political economy that is appropriate to analyze and understand how the interplay between flows of goods, knowledge, people, epigenetic changes, microorganisms, and vectors affects the health of individuals in communities across the globe.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Psychology. Psychology is all around us.It permeates our everyday lives.It is not surprising that the science of psychology has received great interest from behavioral scientists and the general public alike.We are all amateur psychologists.We all want to know what makes us and other people tick! However, our common sense understanding of how people think, feel, and act is often misguided.The self-referential nature of psychology has caused some people to believe that psychology is not a science at all! This course will show you that psychology is a science and encompasses the collaborative efforts of scientists from many different disciplines.Psychology is the study of behavior and mental processes, and as psychologists, we aim to describe, understand, predict, and sometimes change behavior.Psychologists study human behavior and mental life from different perspectives (i.e.
Title of the course: Introduction to Psychology. , biological, individual, and social) and at different levels of analysis (from genes and the brain up to the social and cultural level).We will consider what these different approaches have to offer in our quest for an understanding of the human mind, the brain, and behavior.Along the way, scientific methods of psychological research will be introduced by addressing some of the main questions that drive contemporary psychology: How do we experience fear or happiness? How do we (think we) see the world around us? How do we learn, remember, and forget things? Where should we draw the line between normal and abnormal behavior? How social are humans? When do people harm or help others?.

The Introduction to Psychology has the following ILOs: To engage students in scientific inquiry about psychological processes., To introduce students to the various subfields of psychology as an academic discipline., To gain a basic understanding of the methods of psychological research.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Law and legal Reasoning. This course aims to introduce students to the general content of modern law and the discipline of legal reasoning.These two concepts are interconnected.It is impossible to fully comprehend law without considering the specific perspectives of lawyers, judges, and other experts within the legal system.By the end of the course, students should be able to understand the nature of law and its distinctions from, as well as similarities to, morality.They should also be able to identify the main branches of law and their fundamental institutions, recognize and differentiate the core values underlying these branches, and grasp the essence of legal reasoning and its application to legal issues.Many people assume that studying law involves solely the laws of a particular jurisdiction.
Title of the course: Introduction to Law and legal Reasoning. For example, a Dutch lawyer would study Dutch law, while a German lawyer would focus on German law, with little overlap between these two professions other than their chosen field.However, this perception is misleading.Despite each country establishing its own legal system, the diversity in law is much less significant than one would think.This course emphasizes the idea that law naturally emerges as a solution to various social problems, and thus, similar responses emerge across different societies facing similar problems.While there may be differences in the specifics, concepts such as contracts, property, inheritance, marriage, constitutions, and crimes exist in almost all modern societies.Instead of focusing on specific sets of rules, such as the Dutch Civil Code or the French Criminal Code, this course explores these widely shared problems and institutional responses.
Title of the course: Introduction to Law and legal Reasoning. Regarding legal reasoning, students will be challenged to develop a taxonomy that will aid in their understanding of how law can be used as a tool to address regulatory and redistributive purposes.Furthermore, the course will include a "workshop" where students will analyze a high-profile judgment and identify the logical steps taken by a court to justify its decision..

The Introduction to Law and legal Reasoning has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the basic areas of law (contracts, property, torts, criminal law, international law, etc.)., To familiarize students with the methods of legal reasoning., To illustrate to students how law arises in response to social problems and how it is different from other domains, such as politics and morality.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Political Science. This course will be an introduction to a field of study that is often subdivided into five or more disciplines.The subdivision list includes International Relations, Comparative Government, Political Theory/Philosophy, Public Policy/Public Administration, and finally a state-centric discipline that depends on your country of origin (i.e.American Politics or Dutch Politics, to name two).The course will start with a simple examination of the meaning of the word "politics." How much of politics is really about solving distribution problems? In other words, a limited amount of resources in society must be distributed in some equitable manner.After this initial discussion, the course will move to consider the central themes of Macro politics, with particular emphasis on the classification of political systems, political ideology, and political authority.Themes in Micro politics are addressed in the second half of the course.
Title of the course: Introduction to Political Science. Micro politics refers to the study of how individuals "fit" into their political system.Micro political topics will include political socialization, political groups, elections, voting, political parties, party systems, and political leadership.The course ends with a look at system performance and how to bring about change in political systems when performance is wanting.To help students understand and relate to the political realm in which they exist, each student is required to embark on an individual research paper about their country of origin.It is hoped that this assignment will not only allow students to apply concepts learned in the course but also prompt them to expand their knowledge of how to use resource materials available via the library..

The Introduction to Political Science has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the concepts, ideas, and theoretical underpinnings which constitute the study of government and politics., To outline the scope of political science and its central themes., To provide the intellectual skills necessary for making informed judgments about political issues.. 
Title of the course: Principles of Economics. According to a classic definition, economics is the study of the use of scarce resources that have alternative uses.This course introduces basic economic ideas and concepts.In the lectures, we first study markets, which are the most common allocation mechanism for scarce resources in many economies.We analyze behavior on markets, outcomes of markets, and different market forms.In this section, we also introduce game theory to study situations with strategic interaction, such as oligopolistic competition.Next, we explore the concept of comparative advantage as an explanation of trade patterns.While the first part of the course mainly covers microeconomic topics, the second part is devoted to macroeconomics.In the second part, we begin by considering macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, and then examine economic fluctuations as well as economic policy.Additional topics, such as the monetary system, may be covered in the tutorials.
Title of the course: Principles of Economics. These tutorials provide the opportunity to apply and reflect on some of the contents of the course, through presentations and debates on topics like Behavioral Economics.Overall, this course provides a foundation for many other economics courses at UCM.It is a strict or recommended prerequisite for courses such as SSC2007 (International Macroeconomics), SSC2020 (The Economics of Information), SSC2043 (Development Economics), and SSC2048 (Intermediate Microeconomics)..

The Principles of Economics has the following ILOs: Get acquainted with basic ideas and concepts in economics and be prepared for possible future economics courses.. 
Title of the course: Sociological Perspectives. This course offers an introduction to the social scientific discipline of sociology, with a focus on the study of social problems and crises.The course emphasizes understanding key concepts and their application to foundational areas of sociological research and theory.
Title of the course: Sociological Perspectives. Some of the key questions explored in the class include: What is the basis of sociological thinking? How are individuals influenced by society? How do individuals shape society? What are the factors that drive or prevent large-scale processes of social change? How does society distribute wealth, income, and other important resources? How does society establish political authority and power relations? How are cultural values and beliefs passed down over time? What are the sources of conflict, consensus, and change in society? 

From a global comparative perspective, the course will introduce students to different strands of sociological theory, the various levels of sociological analysis, and the central areas of sociological investigation, such as class, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, media, education, marriage, work, and globalization.
Title of the course: Sociological Perspectives. Throughout the course, attention will be given to applying the sociological lens to analyze pressing social issues and problems in the contemporary world, such as inequality and violence..

The Sociological Perspectives has the following ILOs: To become conversant in the foundations of sociological thought and theory., To gain understanding of the primary areas and topics of sociological analysis., To be able to apply sociological concepts and theories to the study of relevant social problems., To reflect on the relevance and utility of sociology in the everyday world and public policymaking.. 
Title of the course: Introduction to Business Administration. Business administration studies economic problems within the firm and relates them to problems in the fields of marketing, logistics, finance, accounting, information management, organization, and strategy.The goal of business administration is to provide an integrated view of all the various (sub) disciplines.This course introduces students to various topics related to business administration to ensure they have a basic knowledge for more specialized courses in marketing, organization, finance, strategy, supply chain management, and accounting.The course will revolve around a real-life management simulation called Market Place Live..

The Introduction to Business Administration has the following ILOs: To introduce students to topics in business administration, the course also prepares students for courses in marketing, organization, finance, strategy, supply chain management, and accounting.. 
Title of the course: International Relations: Themes and Theories. Please note that this course used to be titled "SSC1006 Introduction to International Relations".Some content and literature of the course and its assessments have been modified to meet the requirements of a 2000-level course.The first part of the course discusses several mainstream International Relations (IR) theories and issues, including neoliberalism, neorealism, and debates about the liberal world system.Moreover, the problematics of soft versus hard power, absolute versus relative gain, cooperating versus cheating, war versus peace will be discussed.In this part, we will not go through world history, contemporary history, main international institutions, or the history of nation-states.We will immediately start studying contemporary IR.The second part of the course covers less mainstream approaches, some 'new' theories, and some neglected issues about the 'other' side of world politics.
Title of the course: International Relations: Themes and Theories. In this part, normative and ideational structures, environmental issues, problems of the developing world, gendered-biases, economic inequalities, the construction of partial knowledge, the legitimization of power politics, the representation of images, establishment of stereotypes, and the reproduction of hegemony will be studied critically.Moreover, new IR approaches like Queer theory and Asian IR approaches will be discussed.In this part, we aim at asking important questions and try to find reflective answers about the role of power and hegemony, how to make IR more green, how to decolonialize knowledge about the world, and how to make IR and politics more gender-sensitive.It is important that students become aware of the theoretical richness of the discipline, and that there is not a single 'right' way to answer questions about what is happening around us in the world.
Title of the course: International Relations: Themes and Theories. Students are given a chance to discuss and apply those theories to different and more specific cases and issues.For this reason, this course is an opportunity to learn and apply international relations theories, concepts, and models to the daily news and real-time developments in the world.Case studies or specific issues are provided by the course literature.Thus, the course is based on active student participation..

The International Relations: Themes and Theories has the following ILOs: To provide students with an in-depth understanding of the main theories and critical approaches in International Relations., To analyze foundational concepts of international politics, such as systems, states, and security., To discuss many key historical and contemporary issues, transformations, actors, and events in International Relations.. 
Title of the course: Clinical Psychology. The course Clinical Psychology is concerned with mental disorders.It aims to understand mental and behavioral distress and dysfunction and to learn how to promote subjective well-being and personal adaptation.The course examines important clinical pictures of various anxiety disorders, eating disorders, addictions, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders based on case descriptions.Throughout the course, questions are continuously raised, such as: What is the clinical picture of...? Where is the boundary between no need for care and need for care? What causes such a disorder? And what can be done about the disorder? It becomes clear that there is a gap between theory and practice, between scientific thinking and clinical treatment.The course also explores different theoretical schools that explain and treat psychiatric disorders according to their favorite theory.
Title of the course: Clinical Psychology. However, the choice of theory and treatment is often based on ideology rather than empirical findings, raising the question of whether this situation is desirable..

The Clinical Psychology has the following ILOs: To familiarize students with the most common psychiatric disorders, including their clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, etiological theories, empirical findings that either support or refute the theories, current treatment approaches, and the effectiveness of therapies., To give students more detailed knowledge of clinical practice by 'working with a client'., To learn basic clinical interview techniques.. 
Title of the course: Developmental Psychology. The development of and changes in psychological functions from birth through adolescence are the topic of this course.These changes will be illustrated with many empirical findings and explained by some theoretical models.Such influential older theories, like Piaget's, will be compared to more recent information processing models of development and evolutionary perspectives.How does a child reason? How does a child become faster and better at learning? How does a child succeed in developing from almost nothing into an adult? How do children learn to perceive and think (the so-called cognitive development)? 

In addition to these questions, attention will be paid to arithmetic development.The social-emotional basis for later development will also be explored, including attachment relations to mothers and fathers.
Title of the course: Developmental Psychology. How do infants form attachments? Is attachment important? Do our early attachments influence our later emotional development? Other social-emotional topics, such as temperament and aggression, will be addressed.The course will also cover differences in development, including disorders like autism and ADHD.When is an active young boy considered normal, and when do we say that he has ADHD?.

The Developmental Psychology has the following ILOs: To teach students about the types of changes that underlie psychological development., To teach students about how children develop psychologically in perception, cognition, language/arithmetic, personality, and emotions from infancy to adolescence., To teach students about developmental disorders such as autism and ADHD., To provide students with knowledge of the elementary biological processes that underlie psychological development., To provide students with knowledge about the learning processes that children have at their disposal, such as habituation and social learning.. 
Title of the course: Intermediate Macroeconomics. In this course, we discuss how national income, employment, and prices are determined.We study long-run economic growth as well as short-run fluctuations in economic activity, unemployment, and inflation.We then analyze tools of fiscal and monetary policies.Throughout this course, economic data is tightly woven into the discussion of economic theory.By the end of this course, we are able to critically assess and contribute to discussions on current economic issues and give an educated assessment on economic commentary, analyses, or policy proposals (for example, in publications such as The Wall Street Journal or The Economist)..

The Intermediate Macroeconomics has the following ILOs: Introduce students to an intermediate level of macroeconomics by linking theory, data, and current policy debates., Provide students with theory-based arguments required to understand relevant macroeconomic issues in academic and policy discourse.. 
Title of the course: Organization Theory. This course is aimed at getting to know more about organizations, gaining an understanding of workplaces, and learning about how to enhance your relationships with the organizations that you encounter throughout your life and career ahead.Organization Theory is a branch of social sciences that is particularly interested in the why, how, and when multiple individuals join efforts to reach a common goal.It is a multidisciplinary subject drawing from disciplines such as arts and humanities, educational sciences, psychology, evolutionary biology, economics, and politics.These multiple lenses through which we view organizations make Organization Theory a fascinating and relevant topic to explore and examine at any stage of your study program.The main topics covered in this course are organization-environment relations, organizational design types and culture, leadership development, HRM and well-being, and managing diversity and inclusion at work..

The Organization Theory has the following ILOs: Provide insight and enhance knowledge about the impact of the external environment on how an organization is designed., Provide insight and enhance knowledge about various organizational designs., Provide insight and enhance knowledge about the components of organizational structure and organizational culture., Provide insight and enhance knowledge on the impact of leadership and learning processes on organization design., Prepare for future practice in designing and managing organizational systems and learning processes., Develop discussion competency, constructive feedback-seeking, and feedback-giving approaches, as well as the capacity to critically analyze within topics and synthesize across topics., Develop the ability to effectively lead discussions and deliver impactful presentations.. 
Title of the course: Corporate Finance and Responsible Investing. Today's business environment is more complicated than ever.This is illustrated by the recent financial crisis and its aftermath, as well as emerging topics such as climate change and corporate social responsibility, which are increasingly affecting corporate decision making.The field of corporate finance deals with the financing and investment decisions made by company management in order to maximize shareholder wealth and address the preferences of other stakeholders.This course provides a broad overview of important issues in corporate finance, drawing on insights from economics and sustainable finance.On the economic side, corporate finance focuses on maximizing shareholder wealth.Managers strive to secure the highest possible return while accepting the least amount of risk.For example, a company may choose to finance itself by borrowing money from banks, issuing bonds, or issuing equity on the stock market.
Title of the course: Corporate Finance and Responsible Investing. These decisions influence the expected return and risk of the company.Traditional economics assumes that managers and investors are rational, self-interested individuals.However, there is a significant body of evidence from social psychology and behavioral economics that suggests people often act irrationally and consider the social impact of their decisions.This course also explores how decision-making biases affect managers and investors in their financial choices, as well as how the social preferences of shareholders and stakeholders impact corporate social responsibility.Investors in both equity and debt claims of companies have diverse social preferences.Increasingly, large institutional asset owners, such as public pension funds, are pressuring companies' management to improve governance quality, environmental performance, and social performance in their investments..

The Corporate Finance and Responsible Investing has the following ILOs: You get a broad overview of the field of corporate finance and responsible investing., You will be able to understand financial articles in newspapers like the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Economist better., You will be able to apply your knowledge to understand the basic financial information of the firm or institutions you will work for., You will deepen your financial knowledge by applying theoretical financial concepts to a chosen listed company throughout the course period.. 
Title of the course: Contending Perspectives in Economics: The Case of Inequality. In recent years, the issue of rising inequality has dominated the media.People's views on inequality are shaped by their perception of the world.Economists are no different.In this course, we will discuss various perspectives in economics such as Neoclassical, Austrian, Marxism, Post Keynesian, (New) Institutionalism, and Feminist Economics.We will focus on these perspectives within the field of economics as a scientific discipline and on how these perspectives differ in their views on inequality.According to some scholars, inequality is a natural phenomenon in a capitalist market economy.It is a fair reward for higher education and training.Some other scholars disagree with this view.They observe that the sharpest inequality stems from other sources than education, and it is not justified by individual merits alone.
Title of the course: Contending Perspectives in Economics: The Case of Inequality. Further, they emphasize that inequality in itself has detrimental effects on societies and therefore it should be prevented as much as possible.Finally, some economists see inequality as the result of economic growth and therefore conclude that increases in societal wealth cannot be attained without inequality.In this course, we will first discuss the main elements within each school of thought, how they emerged, and how they differ from each other.Secondly, we will accompany these discussions with their views and interpretations of inequality.We will discuss various perspectives in which inequality can be regarded, such as the distribution of income amongst capitalists versus workers, income inequality between various groups in society, and the difference between inequality in income versus inequality in wealth.
Title of the course: Contending Perspectives in Economics: The Case of Inequality. How can we explain differences in society and are these differences persistent?

Thirdly, and much related to the previous points, is the role of public policy (or the government).Should, and if so how, the government have an active role in redistributing income? Fourthly, we will also touch upon different measures of inequality and how they can be interpreted.All of this will be discussed in tutorial meetings and students will work on (group) papers.We will present and discuss these papers for which we will also include peer feedback..

The Contending Perspectives in Economics: The Case of Inequality has the following ILOs: Students have a basic understanding of the main competing perspectives in economics., Students are acquainted with various views on inequality and how it can be measured., Students are familiar with discussions on inequality and how scholars' perspectives can be linked to these discussions.. 
Title of the course: European Integration: History and Theory. This course analyzes European integration from the late 1940s until today.In chronological order, it introduces students to themes such as security, economic integration, and enlargement that continue to influence European integration in the present.In parallel, it also provides an overview of the main theories explaining (aspects of) European integration related to these themes, including 'big theories' such as neofunctionalism and neorealism, but also theories dealing with issues such as democratic legitimacy and the EU's normative power.While firmly based in history, the sessions continuously seek to also reflect on the relation between past processes and current developments, such as Brexit or the Rule of Law crisis, as they are unfolding.The course closes with a critical discussion on the main challenges European integration is faced with today and the views developed for its future development..

The European Integration: History and Theory has the following ILOs: To provide students with an in-depth understanding of the developments in European integration during the 20th century., To introduce students to the main theories and concepts in the field of European integration., To critically examine the way the European Union operates in the 21st century as well as to discuss the problems and challenges it currently faces.. 
Title of the course: Brand Management and how to Communicate about Brands. This course covers the foundations of brand management and marketing communications, including advertising.The course will strongly focus on the consumer, discussing the foundation of branding and advertising in consumer behavior and consumer psychology theories.We will explore the theories that form the basis of branding and advertising and then apply them through team assignments focused on students' chosen brands.The course is divided into two parts: 

1.Brand Management: In this section, we will examine the nature of brands in consumers' minds, the concept of brand equity, and the tools for building and leveraging brands.2.Integrated Marketing Communications: In this section, we will explore the concept of Integrated Marketing Communications, the communication process, and theories of consumer behavior and response..

The Brand Management and how to Communicate about Brands has the following ILOs: To give students an introduction to the communication of brands to consumers, on the one hand, a strong theoretical foundation will be built by studying the textbook chapters and journal articles (E-reader). On the other hand, we will continuously translate this theory into practice by means of short articles from the business press (E-reader), brief student presentations, and one larger group project., In addition to being instructive and interesting, this course can also be a lot of fun. We are faced with brands and advertising every single day, and it is challenging to examine the processes by which this is done., To have an in-depth understanding of the theories concerning branding, marketing communication, and consumer behavior, and of the implications of these theories for marketing management. Skills that will be developed/enhanced during this course are: presentation skills, teamwork skills, writing skills, analytical skills, reflection skills, and creativity skills. 

Teaching and Learning Activities: This course consists of 13 tutorial group meetings. Most of the educational group meetings are structured as follows: 

In the first hour, we will critically reflect on and discuss the literature for that meeting. We will explore the theoretical concepts discussed in the articles and chapters and make sure that everyone understands the big picture. 

In the second hour, we will apply the studied literature to practice. The tutorial groups will be divided into three or four teams, and each team will be responsible for a brand throughout the whole course. For four sessions, there is a small team assignment to be prepared by each team about the specific brand the team has chosen. Essentially, it means using "your" brand to give a practical example of the literature. 

Furthermore, there will be a mid-term assessment in the form of a paper of maximum 8 pages, in which you will have to individually reflect on the brand management topic we discussed in the first part of the course. 

In week 7, there will be a final assessment in the form of a team presentation (an integrated communications plan) about your brand and a proposed brand extension. The students' assignment is to reflect on the decision of extending the brand into the proposed category, to decide what the brand extension should look like, and to set up a launch plan for the brand extension (an IMC plan).. 
Title of the course: Social Psychology. Social psychology is the scientific study of the ways in which people's behavior, thoughts, and feelings are influenced by others.This course will cover the core themes from social psychology – such as attitudes and attitude change, conformity, and aggression – and how they can be scientifically investigated.During the course, students will also participate in a "Humans of Maastricht" project.In this project, students will make contact with their self-perceived "out-group," applying social psychological theories and concepts to their experiences and reducing their own stereotypes and prejudice in the process..

The Social Psychology has the following ILOs: To provide an introduction to social psychology.. 
Title of the course: The Economics of Information. This course studies markets for information goods and provides an introduction to the economics of uncertainty and information.The term "information good" is broad and encompasses anything that can be digitized, such as books, databases, music, and more.Consequently, trading often occurs over the Internet.Information goods have distinct characteristics, such as a cost structure with high fixed costs but low marginal costs.Making a copy of digital content has virtually no cost.We delve into various topics including pricing, network effects, and lock-in.A particular emphasis will be placed on "platforms" like Apple's App Store, Google Search Engine, and Netflix, which often play key roles in information goods markets.At the beginning, we introduce concepts from pricing and game theory, building upon the content covered in SSC1027 Principles of Economics.
Title of the course: The Economics of Information. These concepts prove valuable as markets for information goods are often competitive but not perfectly so.As a result, firms can experiment with pricing and selling strategies, while also considering how potential competitors will react.The economics of uncertainty and information explores the significance of information in the decisions and interactions of individuals, the design of contracts, and the functioning of markets.In many situations, individuals lack pertinent information before making decisions.For instance, sellers do not know their customers' willingness to pay, and investors are unaware of the most profitable investment opportunities.Information is frequently not just incomplete, but also unevenly distributed among the involved parties, resulting in "adverse selection" and "moral hazard" scenarios.
Title of the course: The Economics of Information. Examples include job applications, where the applicant possesses more knowledge about their abilities than the employer, and insurance contracts, where the insurance company cannot observe the insured's efforts to prevent damages.A crucial observation is that the asymmetrical distribution of information often leads to economic inefficiency..

The The Economics of Information has the following ILOs: Learn the durable economic principles of markets for information goods., Skills in analyzing such markets typically include:

Title of the course: Accounting and Accountability. This course will provide an introduction to the field of accounting.Accounting is usually seen as the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating financial information about a company to interested users, allowing them to make decisions based on this information.These users can be internal (managers, employees) or external (shareholders, banks, investors).By providing financial information to external users, they can make decisions regarding the firm, such as investing in it or lending money to it.This information also allows investors to predict the future of the company and determine its value.In short, this information allows capital markets to function and provides a healthy economic environment for investment.The communication of financial information is guided by accounting standards, which dictate how it should be recorded and presented to interested parties.
Title of the course: Accounting and Accountability. This course will follow the International Financial Reporting Standards as the framework for recording and communicating financial information.However, despite these accounting standards, managers still have the ability to present information in a certain way, as they have an informational advantage over external users.They may use this advantage to hide certain information or present a more favorable financial picture of the firm.This can have a negative effect on the functioning of capital markets.Therefore, this course will also cover the topics of corporate governance and auditing.These fields aim to put regulations and systems in place to prevent bias in financial statements and detect any intentional or unintentional misstatements.Given the importance of accounting in economic markets, an introduction to this field is beneficial for all students, regardless of their career aspirations.
Title of the course: Accounting and Accountability. All businesses, whether small or large, will need to communicate information to external users.They will also need to have systems in place to provide assurance that this information is accurate.Therefore, whether students pursue careers in business, economics, or entrepreneurship, knowledge of accounting will be valuable in the future..

The Accounting and Accountability has the following ILOs: To provide students with an introduction to the field of accounting., To give students the ability to apply basic bookkeeping techniques (making journal entries and preparing basic financial statements)., To provide an understanding of international accounting rules and principles., To provide an understanding of the basics of related fields like corporate governance and auditing.. 
Title of the course: International Law. The important role played by international law in international relations is evident: it offers not only a means for facilitating international cooperation but also provides a psychological barrier against international delinquencies.These delinquencies include the waging of unlawful wars, the perpetration of widespread and systematic violations of human rights, and the extensive pollution of the environment.Additionally, international law fulfils a vital role in national legal systems.This is because States are obligated to incorporate or implement certain international obligations into domestic law.Examples of such obligations include those derived from human rights treaties, specific resolutions of the UN Security Council, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.This course covers fields of regulation that directly relate to priority issues on the international agenda.
Title of the course: International Law. These priority issues include the law of armed conflicts, international human rights law, and international criminal law.Given these topics, the course should be of great interest to UCM students..

, Compare the structure, applicable laws, and practices of certain international institutions., analyze and solve real or hypothetical problems by applying the rules and principles of international law.. 
Title of the course: Memory. In our everyday cognitive functions, we rely heavily on multiple types of memory.This includes seemingly trivial actions, such as remembering your grocery shopping list, to navigate through Maastricht, and to have a sense of your own identity.How are memories formed and maintained in our mind and brain? Do we have multiple memory systems, or just one memory mechanism from which the richness of memory is derived? What happens if our memory fails us, when we forget or when we remember falsely? This course investigates the behavioral (conditioning), cognitive (information processing), and neurobiological mechanisms of both declarative and non-declarative memory.You will study how some memories are produced automatically by your brain, such as in an operant conditioning paradigm.We will also discuss a number of cognitive models explaining how your explicit experiences are stored in memory.
Title of the course: Memory. Furthermore, we will discuss synaptic and molecular mechanisms of memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and retrieval, and the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms that may strengthen or weaken an existing memory.Finally, we will examine how this knowledge about learning and memory can be transferred to an educational setting such as PBL at Maastricht.These research topics rely on many decades of cognitive and neuroscientific research that has been awarded with Nobel prizes several times (in 2000 to Prof.Kandel for synaptic plasticity and in 2014 to Profs.O’Keefe and Moser/Moser for hippocampal place cells and navigation).Throughout the course, we will discuss relevant methodological issues regarding memory research.
Title of the course: Memory. Importantly, please be aware that brain anatomy and function are an important part of this course; an interest in and understanding of these fields at the level of Introduction to Psychology or higher is strongly recommended.In addition to the tutorial meetings, students will complete a practical and paper assignment in which memory performance of real subjects is assessed..

Title of the course: Law and Society. Legal scholars generally focus their attention on the law as it appears in books, i.e.legal rules.They look at formal manifestations of the law, such as constitutions, statutes, judicial decisions, and court structures.While this is certainly an important aspect of studying law, we would miss a large part of reality if we limited our attention to the formal structures of law and ignored the larger social context in which law operates.While law in action bears some resemblance to law in books, law as a social phenomenon is often far more complex than is apparent from the formal manifestations of law alone.This course looks at the law in action: it studies law as a social phenomenon.Only if we understand how the major elements of a given legal system function together in a specific social context can we really understand how law affects society and how society in turn shapes the law.
Title of the course: Law and Society. The first part of the course will introduce the sociological study of law.We will provide an overview of the field, discuss several prominent theoretical approaches, and examine various methods of researching socio-legal questions.The second part of the course will examine several legal processes in detail, using the tools that were developed in the first half of the course.In particular, we will look at the organization and making of law, law as a means of social control, dispute resolution, and law as a means of social change.We will also look at current developments in the interrelation of law and society.In the second part of the course, students are also encouraged to actively work with the theoretical frameworks studied in the first part (or explore others that were not discussed in the course) in writing a socio-legal research paper..

The Law and Society has the following ILOs: To study law as a social phenomenon and discuss various theoretical approaches to law and society., To examine a variety of legal processes, such as conflict resolution, lawmaking, social control, and change, and to seek to understand how they function empirically., To examine and understand the interrelationships between law (as an academic discipline) and other fields of study., To understand current and future development trends in the nexus of law and society (e.g. legal developments in response to automation, digitalization, and artificial intelligence or in response to new research results in psychology and neuroscience).. 
Title of the course: Classical Social Theory. Classical Social Theory addresses key questions, concepts, and theoretical traditions in sociology and other social sciences.Contemporary perspectives often trace their roots back to these classic theories.Additionally, classical theory shapes the way western society perceives itself and its relationship with others.Thus, despite the push for non-Eurocentric perspectives in academia, we still study the works of men from past centuries.This course aims to provide perspective on the relevance of learning and critically evaluating the classics.Throughout this course, we will delve into the backgrounds, worldviews, and historical context of classical authors such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, and Georg Simmel.Furthermore, we will explore lesser-known authors whose works have influenced contemporary social thinking, such as W.E.B.
Title of the course: Classical Social Theory. Du Bois, Gabriel Tarde, and female pioneers in sociology like Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Jane Addams.Our study materials will include original texts, contemporary interpretations, real-life case studies, and examples.We will critically assess the continued relevance (or lack thereof) of classical theories in today's society.This course is highly valuable to students interested in pursuing master's programs in social sciences, including sociology and anthropology, as well as for any students interested in understanding the foundations of the social sciences..

The Classical Social Theory has the following ILOs: Identify the main theoretical traditions in sociology and situate them in the historical context in which they emerged and were applied., Understand and evaluate the work of early social scientists in a critical and constructive manner., Compare and contrast the theoretical perspectives and methods proposed for constructing social theory., Explain and reflect on how the classics are still relevant to the study of contemporary societies., The classics offer a lens through which we can analyze and interpret contemporary issues., The classics provide a foundation for understanding the development of human thought and culture., They offer insights into universal themes and experiences, such as love, power, justice, and the human condition, which remain relevant across time and space.. 
Title of the course: Political Sociology. In this course, students undertake a collaborative exploration of key themes in political sociology, a major sub-field of sociology with strong linkages to political science and political philosophy.A working knowledge of introductory sociology and social science research methods is absolutely essential and thus required.One of the fundamental problems of concern in this course is to understand the dynamics and relations of power in society.Specific problems and issues related to 'power' are examined across the grassroots and global levels of sociological investigation.Intersectional and global comparative perspectives are stressed through an exploration of diverse case studies that span different historical eras and contemporary settings.Principles of 'research-based learning' (RBL) are emphasized throughout the course in order to stress the intimate link between sociological theory and methodology.
Title of the course: Political Sociology. Through principles of RBL, students will pursue collaborative investigations of some of the most foundational questions and topics that have come to define political sociology over the past few decades.Salient themes to be explored include: democratization, active citizenship, nationalism, neoliberalism, elitism, populism, authoritarianism, repression, protest, and revolution..

Specifically, the objectives of the course are:, To discuss and learn what conflict and peace mean and why groups resort to violence, and what makes peace durable., To discuss conflict types and trends and the peace index in the contemporary world;, To get familiar with conflict theories, conflict studies, peace models, and approaches;, To discuss ontological and epistemological issues regarding conflict and peace studies;, To apply these models, concepts, and theories to various conflicts and peace efforts;, To understand the main techniques of peace-making and conflict resolution, such as mediation, and the efforts of international organizations such as the United Nations;, To discuss peacekeeping and interventions in conflict resolution;, To gain introductory knowledge on ending conflicts and post-conflict reconstruction, peacebuilding, and reconciliation processes.. 
Title of the course: History of Western Political Thought. When considering modern political issues, it is often instructive, and sometimes humbling, to realize that many of these issues have deep historical roots.Throughout the existence of human societies, questions about how these societies should be organized have always been asked.The answers given by historical writers to these questions are still relevant today and continue to shape current political thinking.By examining the questions that historical philosophers grappled with and how they attempted to answer them, we can gain a better understanding of the challenges our societies face and devise our own solutions.We will analyze significant works by numerous influential political thinkers in the Western political tradition from different periods in history.Our goal is to comprehend the specific problems they attempted to address and evaluate whether or not they were successful in doing so.
Title of the course: History of Western Political Thought. While the primary texts we will utilize are historical, our approach will be analytical.Additionally, we will also study several modern texts that explore themes derived from these historical works.By applying the tools and knowledge acquired in the Political Philosophy course (COR1004) to these texts, we will be able to engage with them effectively and apply historical perspectives to contemporary issues..

The History of Western Political Thought has the following ILOs: To provide students with a basic grasp of the evolution of political thought in the Western tradition., To teach students how to study historical works of philosophy., To identify how issues and questions in contemporary politics and contemporary political thought have their roots in historical writings.. 
Title of the course: Development Economics. The long-run economic development of countries, as well as inequality within countries, is the major topic of this course.The course will review the major conceptual approaches to economic development and apply them to the actual experiences of countries.In this way, the global variety of development experiences becomes a central topic of the course, addressing subjects such as investment, trade, building institutions, population dynamics, education, health, and migration.The material that we cover suggests that inequality in the distribution of income, resulting from differences in access to education, health services, or infrastructure among the population, can be a major obstacle to economic development.Throughout the course, public policy options for stimulating development are emphasized, especially in the assignments that students will carry out..

The Development Economics has the following ILOs: To provide participants with an overview of the major characteristics of and conceptual approaches to economic development and the public policies that are used to stimulate it; these topics include, among others, economic growth and population dynamics, education, health, migration, institutions, and environment., To deliver the skills needed to analyze real-world economic development experiences and approach them in a rigorous and critical way..

Title of the course: Intermediate Microeconomics. Economics is the study of exchange and trade-offs.Questions about what to buy, what to produce, and how to allocate time all involve trade-offs between different alternatives, and economists develop models to better understand the process by which individuals and firms make such decisions.With these models in hand, economists can then develop criteria by which to judge the efficiency and effectiveness of market structures, policies, and institutions.This course is a first introduction to microeconomics.It will present an overview of the basic models that constitute the foundations of modern economics.We will build the theory of the consumer and the producer from the bottom up to create models of market behavior.The goal is not to offer a complete description of the world as it exists; rather, we will seek to simplify reality with the goal of providing a concise description of a broad class of real-world circumstances.
Title of the course: Intermediate Microeconomics. As we progress, we will touch on examples of theory in applied settings to highlight and discuss how these models characterize much of the economic behavior we observe in the real world.After developing models of the market as a whole, we'll explore extensions of the theory to the strategic behavior of firms and individuals.The theory of strategic behavior will then be used to analyze, among other things, competition policy, environmental policy, and political competition between parties..

The Intermediate Microeconomics has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the basics of microeconomic theory., To acquire skills in applying their analytical tools to real-life economic problems.. 
Title of the course: Psychology and Law. This course focuses on the applications of psychology to the legal system.It will provide students with insights and knowledge about typical themes within legal psychology.These themes range from the reliability of eyewitness testimonies in court to whether criminals have brain dysfunctions that make them permanently dangerous to society, as well as the role of experts in court.Psychologists play a crucial role within these themes by asking questions that are directly relevant to the legal arena and conducting research to address these questions.By working with cases, students will become familiar with various issues in the field, including police procedures, legal backgrounds, psychological experiments, and the disputes that arise when psychology is applied to the law.In addition, students will have several small exercises in class to give them a taste of the tests and procedures used by academics and professionals in the field.
Title of the course: Psychology and Law. This course draws from various areas of psychology such as social, cognitive, developmental, clinical, and neuropsychology.It will address questions such as: How dangerous are sex offenders?

Title of the course: Entrepreneurship. Not many will contest the societal impact of enterprising individuals and entrepreneurial ventures on our economies.Entrepreneurs may start-up companies that challenge (and often replace) incumbents.In the process, they create new jobs and apply competitive pressure on established firms.Entrepreneurs supposedly have an important direct and indirect effect on driving innovation.Despite the heroic image of successful entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship is much more about failure than about success.What motivates entrepreneurial types to venture off on a path that will often result in failure? In this course, you will study factors that drive entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial process.We will focus on new venture gestation: the initial stages of the process that may result in a new company emerging.
Title of the course: Entrepreneurship. Throughout the course, you will explore how entrepreneurs not only rely on generic business management principles, but also how they cope with the uncertainty, risk, scarcity of time, capital, and other resources that are inherent to all entrepreneurial venturing.Perhaps you will conclude that many entrepreneurs are, in fact, not really good managers (good entrepreneurs will compensate for this by hiring better managers).We start the course by exploring the process dynamics of entrepreneurial activity.We will then explore the origins of entrepreneurial opportunity, review how entrepreneurs screen and develop the opportunities that they discover, and you will unravel how entrepreneurs seek to appropriate the returns from their enterprising behaviour and benefit from or contribute to entrepreneurial networks and ecosystems.
Title of the course: Entrepreneurship. This is not a “how-to” course; instead, the course will introduce you to relevant scholarly insights that provide (future) entrepreneurs with an evidence base for entrepreneurial action.Those students that are ready to enact entrepreneurship may want to contact the recently founded Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, which supports enterprising students and alumni..

Title of the course: Statistics I. The world of statistics is extremely useful, and there's no need to be afraid of it.With 90% confidence and a good deal of effort, you can shock the world of statistics.Numbers will bow to your understanding; quantitative reports in journals and the media will be no match for your critical eye.In Statistics I, you will take your first steps on the path towards mastery of statistics.This course takes a classical approach to statistics and quantitative research methods for social and life sciences.It starts with descriptive statistics (getting the hang of a sample) and continues with inferential statistics (generalizing sample results to entire populations).But don't mistake "classical" for "traditional".Statistics deserves to be colorful and exciting, so prepare yourself for a course full of relatable and relevant stories.Our goal is to make you fall in love with a field that you never knew you liked.
Title of the course: Statistics I. By the end, you will know how to visualize and summarize variables, test null hypotheses, construct confidence intervals, and capture associations between categorical as well as quantitative types of data.And you will be excited that you now understand everything the previous sentence said.Learning statistics is all about interacting with it.Throughout the six course modules, you will solve a myriad of assignments that will help you build – and trust – a quantitative intuition.You will learn many ways in which statistics can help us make sense of the world...and where its limits lie.The overarching goal is to build bridges between mathematical models and our actual universe, in order to make the latter a better place.Who wouldn't want to take part in that endeavor? Now is your chance.We hope to see you in class!.

The Statistics I has the following ILOs: To foster a quantitative mindset for conducting research and understanding the world around you., To develop the ability to think critically about data, as well as scientific articles that are grounded in quantitative techniques., To gain experience in actively performing quantitative analyses yourself, through the use of the program SPSS.. 
Title of the course: Foundations of Cognitive Psychology. The mechanization of thought, i.e., regarding the human mind as an information processing machine, has both repelled and attracted psychologists and philosophers after the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries.As a result, human thought was not always the topic of psychology, especially during the rise of radical behaviorism in the early 20th century.Anything referring to mental processes was not to be used in explanations of human behavior.However, with the invention of computers that could mimic behavior, along with the failure of behaviorism to account for even the simplest human behavior, the focus on the mind returned to psychology.And it returned with a vengeance.During the 1960s and 1970s, information processing theory became the leading paradigm in psychology and remains a major influence to this day, especially in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience.
Title of the course: Foundations of Cognitive Psychology. Information processing theory utilizes concepts of computation and representation and deals with how people receive, store, integrate, retrieve, and use information.The present course is concerned with theoretical and empirical perspectives on human cognition, perception, and the experimental methods used to study cognition and perception.Eleven basic topics of cognitive science/psychology are discussed using a Problem Based Learning format.The first part of the course covers basic concepts in cognitive science, while the second part applies those concepts to major topics in psychology.Some of the topics studied in the course include the history of the study of the human mind as an information processing machine, computation, representation, top-down and bottom-up processing, semantic networks and spreading of activation, imagination, attention, language, and emotion..

The Foundations of Cognitive Psychology has the following ILOs: To give students an overview of the study of the human mind as an information processing machine over time and provide insight into the foundations of cognitive science., To make students familiar with the basic concepts used in theories on human information processing and the experimental designs used in cognitive psychology., To provide insight into the nature of cognitive processes, various forms of perception, learning, and thinking are examined.. 
Title of the course: The Psychology of Individual Differences: Personality and Intelligence. This course will provide you with knowledge of the most important scientific theories and empirical findings on personality and intelligence.You will learn why and when a person behaves differently than someone else and how personality impacts what will happen to us in our life.We will also discuss practical applications of theory and research findings and learn to apply measurement techniques for assessing individual differences.You will learn about different theoretical conceptualizations and measurement approaches to personality and intelligence.Based on the purpose of the assessment, different methods may prove more or less valuable.You will also discover different explanations for why people differ in their personalities and their levels of intelligence.We will look at physiological, evolutionary-genetic, as well as contextual explanations.
Title of the course: The Psychology of Individual Differences: Personality and Intelligence. Further, you will look closely at the relationship between personality, intelligence, and meaningful life events.What personality traits are essential for marital satisfaction and what characteristics make us become a criminal? But also – how does becoming a parent or getting a new job change our personality? Lastly, you will be introduced to real-life applications of knowledge on personality and intelligence.Specifically, we will discuss how this knowledge is used in clinical settings (e.g., when having patients with personality disorders) and in organizational settings (e.g., for personnel selection purposes).Please be aware that this course needs a time investment from your side.You will need to find literature individually and actively construct knowledge.Just summarizing articles and learning those summaries by heart will not help you during this course.
Title of the course: The Psychology of Individual Differences: Personality and Intelligence. You need to be prepared to invest your time in finding articles, understanding them, and applying the understanding you gain to real-life scenarios.There will be no clear this-is-correct-and-this-is-wrong-approach in this course, as you will need to argue for your positions based on academic sources.If you are looking for a course that provides you with the readings and then everyone just reads out loud the same studydrive summaries during tutorials, then this course is not for you.If, on the other hand, you are eager to invest your time in your intellectual growth and are prepared to experience some moments of uncertainty to finally get a better understanding of the psychology behind individual differences, then this course is for you..

The The Psychology of Individual Differences: Personality and Intelligence has the following ILOs: Gain insights into the two key subdivisions in the study of individual differences in humans: personality and intelligence.. 
Title of the course: Migration Studies: Flows and Concepts. This course will examine the following concepts in contemporary migration studies: forced migration and refugees; irregular and transit migration; integration and transnationalism; and return migration and reintegration.The course will introduce students to both the complexities and challenges of migration and the potential positive effects of migration.Throughout the course, multiple case studies will be examined to highlight different migrant concepts and flows..

The Migration Studies: Flows and Concepts has the following ILOs: To provide students with a basic overview of migration flows and concepts., To provide insight into the complexity of human movement., To familiarize students with different cases and examples of various global migration flows.. 
Title of the course: Theories of Social Order. In the past decade, societal order seemed to be under attack in many Western countries.Activists from the right and the left challenged existing orders and increased societal strife.Political polarisation has eroded social cohesion and pitted people against one another.And then, the COVID-19 pandemic struck.BLM, #MeToo, alt-right movements, mass shootings, popular uprisings, police violence, fierce debates about climate change and gender equality and LGBTQ-rights and rising inequalities: they all relate to social order in one way or another.In tempestuous times, questions about social order become important.What makes society work? What unites us? What divides us?

In "Theories of Social Order," we use a sociological perspective to study the different types of glue that hold societies together.
Title of the course: Theories of Social Order. For sociologists, the root of the problem of social order lies in the sometimes conflicting interests of individuals and those of groups (and societies).Whenever individual interest conflicts with group interest, social order is at risk.A solution to the problem requires the reconciliation of individual and collective interests, but how to do that is not a given.Theorists have provided several answers to this vexing question.We consider five mechanisms that produce social order: individuals, hierarchies, markets, groups, and networks.Foundational texts by classic sociologists are combined with contemporary extensions and empirical applications on contemporary problems of social order, i.e.(1) political polarisation in the US and Europe, and (2) the corona pandemic.The editorial introductions by Hechter & Horne provide the background for each of these texts and link them to the central problem.
Title of the course: Theories of Social Order. The strengths and weaknesses of the various theories are discussed, by relating them to contemporary events whenever feasible.We also explore how to test theories against evidence.In this way, students will improve their understanding of the social world and will learn to apply the analytical tools to real-life phenomena..

The Theories of Social Order has the following ILOs: To introduce students to the way classical and modern sociologists theorize about society and, in particular, to introduce students to a core theoretical issue in the social sciences: the problem of social order., To develop skills in identifying and analyzing theoretical arguments., To understand how sociologists use different types of evidence to understand society., To apply abstract theories to new, concrete empirical situations.. 
Title of the course: Social Studies of Finance: The Making (and Taking) of Value in the Financialization of Our Lives. What is financial value, and what is the value of finance? In this course, we will evaluate the global reach and local impacts of our current financial system, including the financialization of more and more aspects of our everyday lives like housing, education, work, medical care, retirement, and even art.From a variety of perspectives, we will learn about the histories, practices, and theories behind the crises-struck but seemingly inevitable rise of finance into the 21st century.The way we know about money and finance today is changing.In fact, a global economic crisis has become a crisis of orthodox Economics.But, what exactly is a crisis, and who decides?

In November 2008, only weeks after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Queen Elizabeth inaugurated a new building at the London School of Economics.
Title of the course: Social Studies of Finance: The Making (and Taking) of Value in the Financialization of Our Lives. Referring to "the financial crisis", she asked the professors, "Why did nobody notice it?" In a written reply, the scholars explained that the reason "was principally a failure of the collective imagination of many bright people, both in this country and internationally, to understand the risks to the system as a whole." This course introduces attempts to re-imagine our knowledge of money and finance by many "other" bright people, among which anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, philosophers, artists, and even some economists.We will discuss contested notions of public and private ownership, debt and investment, speculation, risk and uncertainty, as well as regulation and taxation.
Title of the course: Social Studies of Finance: The Making (and Taking) of Value in the Financialization of Our Lives. Instead of dealing with business cases, the course explores different fields of finance ethnographically, providing glimpses of the worlds of central banking, corporate and shadow banking, private wealth management, and new digital financial technologies also known as "fintech".Based on these examples, we will consider the meanings of financial vocabularies (e.g.those of collateral and leverage), as well as the legal codes of financial derivatives (such as credit default swaps).We will analyze capitalist ethics of growth and financial profitability, as well as the ideals and rhetoric of trust and transparency that often clash with opaque realities of corruption and fraud.Projecting the dominant temporalities and politics of finance against an urgent backdrop of global humanitarian and ecological crises, we will learn that price is not to be equated with value(s).
Title of the course: Social Studies of Finance: The Making (and Taking) of Value in the Financialization of Our Lives. But how do the values of finance affect us today, and what are the prices we are willing to pay for the failures of its imagined futures?.

The Social Studies of Finance: The Making (and Taking) of Value in the Financialization of Our Lives has the following ILOs: To introduce the history and theories of money and finance., To critically analyze the practices of finance and financialization., To relate the social studies of finance to current issues., To learn how to write a review article,. 
Title of the course: Latin America: History, Politics and Cultures. What we call America is a continent that Europe only came to know existed a little more than 500 years ago.The idea of a "Latin" America is even more recent.This course expects to offer students different perspectives to think about Latin American societies and provide students with an overview of key Latin American social issues and theories.We will begin by reflecting on "the idea of Latin America" from the standpoint of decolonial theory.We will look at the continent before the arrival of Europeans and learn about the history of conquest and colonization.The look at Latin American history will also focus on the process of organizing the newly independent states during the 19th century and the challenges associated with building a national identity.
Title of the course: Latin America: History, Politics and Cultures. The tasks will then focus on more recent events such as the military regimes and state violence of the second half of the 20th century, the struggles for constructing a public memory, the problem of narcotraffic, the US-Latin American relations, and the presence and struggles of Latinos in the US.The course will finish with tasks around the topics of Gender, Race, and Ethnicity, finalizing with a discussion of what alternatives to mainstream development paradigms Latin America has to offer.Transversal topics will be social inequality, marginalized groups' social struggles, and the alternative politics of women, blacks, and indigenous social movements..

The Latin America: History, Politics and Cultures has the following ILOs: Be familiar with the events and debates about the history, politics, and cultures of Latin America and explain the continuities and breaks with colonial times., Identify and critically reflect on some of the most pressing social issues faced by Latin American societies and how they differentially affect specific groups.

Some of the most pressing social issues faced by Latin American societies are pervasive inequality, poverty, violence, and corruption. These issues have a differential impact on specific groups within society, including indigenous peoples, Afro-Latinos, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

Firstly, inequality is a significant social issue in Latin America, with vast disparities in wealth distribution. The wealthiest few benefit from the region's resources, while the majority of the population struggles to meet their basic needs. This inequality perpetuates a cycle of poverty that affects specific groups disproportionately.

Indigenous peoples in Latin America face multiple challenges due to social, economic, and political marginalization. They often experience discrimination, limited access, Explain and reflect on Latin America's relationships with other regions of the world., Apply Latin American theoretical perspectives to deconstruct essentialized or stereotypical images of the region.. 
Title of the course: European Foreign Policy. The course is divided into three sections.The first section will start with a focus on the importance of European Foreign Policy for foreign policy analysis.It will also consider what theories in International Relations can help explain the conduct of European Foreign Policy.This section will then move on to consider the institutional framework of the EU’s foreign policy, the role of the Member States in the formation of policy and then finally consider in more detail the main external relations policies themselves.The main policy areas include Common Defense Policy, Common Security Policy, Economic and Trade Policy and Enlargement Policy.The second section deals with the important regions and particular states that the European Union has established strong foreign policy relationships.These important regions and states include the United States, Russia, the Developing world and Emerging Economies, in particular China.

Through lectures, traditional PBL-focused tutorials, and simulations, students will acquire detailed knowledge of how the principal legal organs of the UN - the General Assembly (Sixth Committee), the Security Council, and the International Court of Justice - work in practice. Students will learn about the centrality of the UN in the international legal system, explore its interaction with other international institutions, and consider the scope for its reform.. 
Title of the course: The Social Study of Environmental Problems: Between Nature, Society, and Politics. Environmental problems such as chemical pollution, global warming, acid rain, and species loss are both material effects of human interaction with nature and nexuses of social practice and political contestation.This course aims to explore the complex connections between nature, society, and politics, which shape the formation, experience, problematization, interpretation, and contestation, as well as governance, of the environment in diverse socio-cultural contexts.The course encourages students to develop a critical perspective on prevailing patterns of industrial production and consumption and to question how our societies can become more sustainable.To achieve this, the course draws upon insights from various disciplines, including environmental history, environmental sociology, science and technology studies, sustainability studies, and recent debates on the "Anthropocene".
Title of the course: The Social Study of Environmental Problems: Between Nature, Society, and Politics. By doing so, it aims to complement the objective-oriented approach of the natural sciences with a reflective understanding of the politics that shape our knowledge (and lack thereof) about the environment.The course is divided into four sections.The first three sections center around three key aspects of nature-society-politics relationships: the risks associated with industrial production, biodiversity and land, and global climate change.The final section reflects on how we can utilize these insights to develop a comprehensive understanding of the Anthropocene and adopt transformative political approaches..

The The Social Study of Environmental Problems: Between Nature, Society, and Politics has the following ILOs: To introduce students to central themes and concepts in the interdisciplinary social study of the environment., Enables students to engage in normative reflection and valuation of major socio-ecological challenges.. 
Title of the course: Middle Eastern Politics. The Middle East is not only a geographical region or location; it is also a politicized and highly contested concept whose representation sometimes overshadows the actual reality.The Middle East has always been a subject of political and academic debates, thanks to its controversial history, its demography, and its major actors.It is also a topic of economic debates due to its abundant natural resources, and security debates due to the wars and conflicts that have affected the global structure as a whole.The Middle East is infamous for hosting powerful, undemocratic, and repressive political regimes, while at the same time, it is home to extremely vibrant civil societies, record-breaking numbers of bloggers, and online youth activism.It has been an arena where great powers have tried to extend their political, ideological, and economic ambitions and have intervened almost regularly.
Title of the course: Middle Eastern Politics. For some, the Middle East is a common and generic name for societies that share the same religion, language, history, and culture.However, for more careful observers, it is an extremely diverse area where various groups speak different languages and practice distinct religions that have persisted for centuries.For critical minds, the Middle East is not an objective and neutral space, but a politically constructed concept that is reproduced through certain discourses, representations, and practices.In any case, the Middle East has always been a birthplace or meeting place for a complex combination of significant political, social, cultural, religious, ideational, and economic actors, issues, and movements.The purpose of this course is to shed light on this incredibly interesting and debated region and discuss its historical, economic, social, and, most importantly, political realities.
Title of the course: Middle Eastern Politics. This course will investigate both the past and the present of the region.It will begin by introducing the concept of the Middle East, not only as a geographical place but also as a cultural, contextual, discursive, and political concept.Then, the course will delve into the history of the region and its ongoing effects on current developments.In this context, major events, ideas, issues, both external and internal actors, and political movements that have shaped the Middle East will be introduced.In the remaining time, specific and contemporary issues such as interventions in the 21st century, the Arab Spring, the Syrian civil war, and rising rivalries between regional powers will be discussed and critically analyzed..

The Middle Eastern Politics has the following ILOs: To critically investigate and analyze the historical and political processes and actors in the Middle East and their impacts on the contemporary economic, social, cultural, and political landscape in the region., To assess the effect of local, regional, and global power relations and rivalries in the Middle Eastern states and societies. To critically examine the role of these relationships in the 'formation' and 'portrayal' of the Middle East., To understand several significant historical issues, actors, ruptures, critical turning points, and transformative processes in the region., Linking these historical processes to the study of the Middle East today and trying to make sense of contemporary events, conflicts, actors, and issues in the Middle East., To explore the role of bottom-up and top-down processes, discourses, subjectivities, and identities; to bring subaltern, hidden, silenced, invisible, and irrelevant issues to the surface.. 
Title of the course: Public Economics. How can we limit global warming? Who should provide education and health care? Is growing income inequality a problem? Should we have a universal basic income? Questions like these are at the core of the field of public economics.Public economics (or public finance) is the study of the role of government in the economy.It is all about the formulation, execution, and effects of government policy.Studying public economics involves answering the following four broad questions: 

1.When should the government intervene in the economy? 
2.How might the government intervene? 
3.What is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes? 
4.Why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? 

We will return to these questions throughout the entire course.In each tutorial, we will discuss one specific policy challenge or societal problem —just like those mentioned in the very beginning.
Title of the course: Public Economics. During the tutorials, we will start with the first question and ask whether there is a justification for government intervention.Afterwards, we will turn to questions two and three and discuss potential policy responses and their effects.The aim of the tutorials is to learn about the way economists think about these challenges and how to incorporate them into economic models.The government differs from other organizations because it can use legal instruments to enact policies.It may also have different goals than other actors in the economy.However, as economists, we often call for free markets and argue in favor of free exchange among firms and individuals, since the price mechanism is an efficient allocation mechanism for scarce resources.So why even have a government? 

Market Failures: One reason is just that the real world is way nastier than our cute theoretical models.In the real world, we regularly see that markets fail.
Title of the course: Public Economics. Reasons can be, for example, that private actors do not internalize all their costs, that buyers and sellers have asymmetric information, the tragedy of the commons, or the presence of monopolies.We will discuss several such cases in Part II of the course.Fairness: Even if markets worked perfectly fine, we may conclude that efficiency alone is not a sufficient criterion.In Part III of the course, we will focus on fairness issues and discuss aspects of inequality, poverty, welfare, and redistribution.This course provides basic knowledge of public policy.After the course, you should be able to critically assess political and economic discussions pertaining to the public sector..

The Public Economics has the following ILOs: Understand how economists think about government intervention and public policy., Apply economic models to calculate and predict the effects of policy reforms., Analyze current policy challenges such as limiting climate change and addressing rising inequality.. 
Title of the course: Public Policy Evaluation. This course provides students with an academic and practical approach to the study of public policy and, more specifically, the professional practice of policy analysis and evaluation.Public policies can be defined as "a course of government action or inaction in response to public problems" such as limited access to healthcare or education, environmental degradation, workplace safety concerns, corruption, traffic congestion, or air pollution (Kraft and Furlong 2010:5).These problems can range from simple to complex and can occur at various levels, from local to global.They often reflect conflicts over causes, solutions, problem definitions, and fundamental human values.Decision-makers responsible for making final decisions on these issues need to be informed by evidence-based policy analysis and evaluation.It is the task of the policy analyst/evaluator to provide sound evidence, analysis, and advice.
Title of the course: Public Policy Evaluation. To prepare students for these tasks, this course aims to develop critical thinking and understanding of public policy and alternative courses of action.Students will deliberate and analyze key concepts, models, approaches, and methods of policy analysis and evaluation, as well as practice basic skills.In the first week of the course, students will explore the nature of policy analysis and evaluation, considering the role of power, politics, institutions, and actors in the policy-making process.The second week will focus on problem structuring, while in the third week, students will learn how to work with evaluative criteria and choose policy options to formulate policy advice.The knowledge gained in these three weeks will be applied as students work in small groups to prepare and present a policy advice based on a real-life country case.
Title of the course: Public Policy Evaluation. Prior to the midterm exam, students will be introduced to two commonly used methods of policy analysis and evaluation: cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis.The midterm exam will consist of an individually written policy memorandum and a team role play based on that memorandum.After the midterm, the course will shift focus from acquiring basic knowledge to exploring policy evaluation approaches in greater depth.Students will learn about plan, process, and outcome evaluations based on the realist or theory-based evaluation approach.They will have the opportunity to conduct and present a plan and/or process evaluation in small groups, using another real-life case.Finally, the course will explore ethical and accountability aspects of policy analysis and evaluation, as well as the role of the public in the process.
Title of the course: Public Policy Evaluation. Throughout the course, students will engage with six cases, some of which will span multiple tutorials, and attend lectures delivered by both academic and professional practitioners who will share their knowledge and experiences.In addition to studying academic and policy literature, students will also engage in hands-on work with evaluation cases.This combination of lectures, case studies, and practical work will facilitate the learning process in this policy analysis and evaluation course..

Title of the course: War in World Politics. Why do nations and states go to war? This course will endeavor to give some answers to this question.The course is divided into three sections that mirror the above objectives.The first section will focus on the different types of conflict.In this section, the ethics of war will also be discussed: do "Just Wars" exist? Section two will concentrate on the causes of conflict.It will reflect upon a variety of sources that emerge from such domains as the global system, the states themselves, and/or individuals.Part three will examine as case studies a number of modern conflicts, such as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the breakup of Yugoslavia, the War between India and Pakistan, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and Saddam Hussein's Wars against Iran and Kuwait..

The War in World Politics has the following ILOs: To understand international conflicts., To examine different types of conflicts and their various causes in the world., To examine various conflicts throughout history as case studies.. 
Title of the course: Social Movements. This course is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of social movements.An overview of the field will be provided by identifying key concepts, theories, and methods through an examination of a variety of case studies.Salient themes addressed will include democracy, identity, globalization, civil rights, environmentalism, gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity/race.While much attention will be placed on social movements within Europe and North America, a global-comparative perspective will be periodically emphasized.The overarching goal of the course will be to reveal the ways in which social movements work to both produce and resist social change.Some of the main questions addressed in the course will be: What is a social movement? Why do people join social movements? How do movements gain/lose momentum? What is the relationship between social movements and democracy? And, under what conditions do social movements 'succeed'?.

The Social Movements has the following ILOs: To become conversant in the major questions driving social movement research., To become conversant in the key theories and concepts that drive social movement research., To become conversant in the primary methods driving social movement research, one must actively engage with the literature and attend relevant conferences and workshops.

Furthermore,, To evaluate and assess social movement research in a critical and constructive manner., To design a case study and initiate an original empirical study on social movements., To reflect on the relevance and utility of studying social movements.. 
Title of the course: Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurship. Interest in the concept of social and sustainable entrepreneurship has been sparked over the last two decades due to the increasing complexity of societal and environmental problems.An explicit and central social/sustainable mission, innovation, creativity, and a strong market orientation are the distinguishing features of social and sustainable entrepreneurship.Social and sustainable entrepreneurs are committed to furthering a social and/or sustainable mission and rank social, environmental, or cultural impact above profit.At the intersection of business, government, and not-for-profit organizations, these social and sustainable entrepreneurs are now visible and having an impact on a global scale.This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn how you can apply your knowledge and skills to address complex sustainability problems.
Title of the course: Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurship. The course is structured around experiential problem-based learning, providing you with the opportunity to synthesize theory and practice as you develop an idea for your own social/sustainable enterprises.Topics will include critically reviewing concepts, user-centered design of social and sustainable enterprises, frameworks for understanding and strategizing, understanding and reporting social and environmental impact, and cross-sector collaboration..

The Social and Sustainable Entrepreneurship has the following ILOs: On successful completion of this course, you should be able to:, Critically reflect on social and sustainable entrepreneurship theory and practice.

Social and sustainable entrepreneurship theory and practice are subjects that require careful consideration. The concepts behind these forms of entrepreneurship involve finding innovative and impactful ways to address societal and environmental issues.

However, it is important to note that the text contains a typographical error. The word "correcy" in the text should be corrected to "correct." Therefore, the corrected, Identify and evaluate social and sustainable entrepreneurship opportunities, Develop a strategy for a social/sustainable enterprise., Conduct primary research and analyze primary and secondary data in the field of social and sustainable entrepreneurship., Prepare and present documentation to pitch an innovative enterprise idea., Learn to cope with the chaos and complexity of doing social and sustainable entrepreneurship in the real world.. 
Title of the course: Statistics II. In Statistics II, we continue our quantitative journey to the realms of even greater adventure.Statistics I has shown you that statistics need not be intimidating; that many can master it – and enjoy doing so.With the foundations of inferential statistics under your belt (confidence intervals, p-values, and the like), as well as an arsenal of different tests, things are about to get bigger and better.This course will prepare you to tackle even more questions in the social and life sciences that call for quantitative answers.The key distinction, which sounds far less exciting than it really is, is that it’s time for ‘models with more variables’.After refreshing the different t-tests (one sample, independent and paired), we shall discuss one- and two-way ANOVA.After that, two weeks will be devoted to regression analysis.
Title of the course: Statistics II. Simple regression will come to pass again, but we will soon expand it with dummy variables and then to multiple regression (with more than one independent variable).The last part of the course will introduce you to repeated measures ANOVA (RANOVA for short), which remains a staple in research in the social sciences.But don’t mistake all these technical terms for a series of bone-dry discussions.Statistics deserves to be colorful and exciting, so prepare yourself for a course full of relatable and relevant stories.If Statistics I did not yet make you fall in love with a field you never knew you liked, our mission is to finally steal your heart away this time.Just like before, learning statistics is all about interacting with it.Throughout the six course modules, you will solve a myriad of assignments that will help you grow – and trust – your quantitative intuition.
Title of the course: Statistics II. You will learn how you can make statistical software do your bidding and apply your understanding of mathematical models to make sense of the world around you… more than ever.Who wouldn’t want to take part in that? Now is your chance – again.We hope to see you back in class!.

The Statistics II has the following ILOs: To expand on the quantitative mindset that you developed in SSC2061 Statistics I., To further develop the ability to think critically about data, as well as scientific articles that are grounded in quantitative techniques., To gain experience in actively performing quantitative analyses yourself, making use of the (more advanced features of the) tool SPSS.. 
Title of the course: Human Reasoning and Complex Cognition. The present course focuses on theoretical and empirical perspectives on human reasoning and complex cognition.Reasoning involves making deductive or inductive inferences and evaluating them based on current goals, beliefs, and knowledge.Decision making involves choosing between alternatives, such as different mental models.Additionally, the course discusses various theoretical and empirical findings on problem solving and judgment.These topics are crucial for humans, and although some individuals may reason better or make more sound decisions than others, thinking remains a significant and uniquely human characteristic.The study of human thought falls under the field of Cognitive Psychology.Similar to other subjects studied by psychologists, higher cognition comprises multiple explanatory models that highlight different aspects of human thought.
Title of the course: Human Reasoning and Complex Cognition. The course employs a Problem Based Learning format to explore eleven topics related to complex cognition in cognitive psychology.These topics include reasoning (hypothetical), the psychology of decision making, emotions and complex cognition, deductive and inductive reasoning (heuristics and biases), creative problem solving, moral judgment, and socio-economic decision making (pro-social behavior: risk and trust)..

The Human Reasoning and Complex Cognition has the following ILOs: To help students acquire knowledge of recent psychological theories in the field of reasoning, decision making, problem solving, and moral judgment., To provide an insight into the role that higher cognitive processes have in directing human behavior, various forms of human reasoning, decision-making, problem-solving, creativity, etc., To explore a given topic in the psychology of thought by writing a client consultancy report (group work).. 
Title of the course: Philosophy of Mind. The mind-body problem is a legacy from the scientific revolution, which started in the 16th century and reached its culmination point with Newtonian physics.Starting with Galileo’s and Descartes’ formulation of this problem, we will discuss different philosophical positions in a more in-depth fashion.In the behavioral and neurosciences, these problems transform into questions about consciousness, conscious experience, and conscious perception.Those topics disappeared from science with the rise of behaviorism in the early twentieth century.But now they are back in the behavioral and neurosciences again.Only over the past few decades has consciousness reappeared in cognitive science and neuropsychology.We will start this course with some philosophy, then we will scrutinize modern-day sciences, especially cognitive science and neuroscience, for ideas on mind and consciousness.
Title of the course: Philosophy of Mind. At the end of the course, we will go back to philosophy and ask ourselves whether all this empirical knowledge from psychology and neuroscience has brought us further in unraveling the brain-consciousness (or mind-body) problem..

The Philosophy of Mind has the following ILOs: To acquaint students with current ideas, philosophical arguments, and empirical evidence on the nature of mind and the relationship between mind and body, we focus on modern cognitive and neuropsychological theories in the area of consciousness. Philosophical reflection on the caveats and problems associated with the notion of consciousness will be stimulated. Suggested topics for discussion include the mind-body problem, dualism, and the role of neuroscience in studying consciousness.. 
Title of the course: The Law of the European Institutions. This course focuses on the institutions of the European Union.At the same time, it provides an opportunity for students to be exposed to legal thinking.Law is central to the process of European integration, and it plays a greater role in European affairs than it does at the national or international level.It is essential for students to become familiar with the ways of legal thought and legal reasoning if they want to fully understand the European integration process and European matters more generally..

The The Law of the European Institutions has the following ILOs: At the end of the course, students should have acquired adequate knowledge, practical skills, and a critical understanding with respect to the following:, The role and significance of law in the European integration process are crucial, The legal foundations of the European Union (EU), as set out in the Treaties., The institutions of the EU, their historical evolution, and the horizontal relationship between them (as reflected in decision-making procedures)., The vertical relationship between the EU and the Member States (including the principles of supremacy, legality, subsidiarity, proportionality, and loyalty)., The implementation and enforcement mechanisms of EU law (infringement proceedings, enforcement through national courts, review of EU action)., The position of the individual as a holder of fundamental rights and a citizen of the Union. In addition, throughout the course, the students should have become familiar with legal thinking and legal reasoning, and should in particular be able to:, Find legal instruments in paper or electronic formats., Keep abreast of recent legal developments., Read the legal document and extract the relevant information from it., Construct a legal argument on a basic issue of EU law., Use EU law to provide an opinion on a legal problem.. 
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. The first part of the course introduces the leading concepts and theoretical frameworks that will structure the course.The course therefore firstly addresses the concept of the ‘atrocity triangle’ and it looks into the relationship between the three actors (the perpetrator, the victim, and the bystander) involved in the triangle.Subsequently, an integrated criminological model will be introduced, which sets out the relevant etiological elements that will be addressed in greater detail in the second part of the course.The second part of the course, which focuses on the perpetrators, will start with the forms, functions, and effects of (political) violence and the concept of torture in particular.The analysis continues on the macro level and addresses the role of policy and ideology.
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. Subsequent analysis focuses on the meso level, and the role of military organizations and other institutions is discussed.In this context, attention is paid to the influence of military training, and we will discuss how with the help of a bureaucratic system, genocide can be planned, organized, and carried out.The discussion will thus address several compulsive and determinative features of the environment surrounding perpetrators of gross human rights violations.Furthermore, we will discuss several experiments (Milgram, Ash, Stanford, etc.) on obedience, institutional roles, and conformity.We will also address other social-psychological mechanisms which are helpful in understanding how and why people are able to participate in the perpetration of gross human rights violations.
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. Lastly, the important role that language and discourse play in conflict and international crime is highlighted.The third part of the course will focus on the bystander.We will start the discussion on the role of the bystander by looking into the phenomenon of the ‘the bystander effect’ in order to address the question of why bystanders fail to act.Secondly, the role of bystanders in international politics at the macro-level of both states and international organizations in the field of human rights will be discussed.We will give special attention to the role of the UN Security Council when it was confronted with gross human rights violations.Lastly, in addition to perpetrators and bystanders (collaborators), certain actors in the same situations did not perpetrate or passively stand by, instead, they took affirmative action and came to the help of those in need.
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. We will therefore look more closely into the phenomenon of rescuing in order to find out what turns actors into rescuers.The fourth and last part of the course will take a more victimological perspective, which focuses on the position of the victim.Who are the victims and why are they victimized? What is the relationship between these victims and their perpetrators, and what are the consequences of this relationship? In this context, specific attention will be paid to gender-selective violence.More particularly, the phenomena of rape as a ‘weapon of war’ and gendercide (gender-selective mass killings) will be discussed.Also, the complex case of child soldiers will be addressed as they are victims and perpetrators at the same time.Several lectures will be held during this course.
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice.During the lectures, various guest speakers will address the subject matter from the practitioner’s perspective.In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post-discussion.We hope that, through these documentaries, the subject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract.Case studies play an important role throughout the course, and we will therefore pay attention to a wide variety of cases, including The Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armenia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.).
Title of the course: Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations. Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide, and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well.Here one could think of the following cases: Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, East Timor, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Central African Republic, etc.Not to forget the torture practices of the U.S.The insights gathered throughout this course have policy implications and inform us how we could react to gross human rights violations once they have occurred.These policy implications are addressed in greater detail during another UCM course titled "The aftermath of atrocity: A course on transitional justice and post-conflict reconstruction" (SSC 3052), which will be taught during the spring semester in period 5..

The Atrocity Triangle: A course on the Criminology of Gross Human Rights Violations has the following ILOs: To gain a criminological understanding of gross human rights violations and other international crimes, we examine their causes at individual (micro), institutional (meso), national, and international (macro) levels using a criminological approach that integrates relevant insights from different disciplines such as social psychology, sociology, victimology, history, international relations, international law, and psychology., Moreover, to view the world through the eyes of the perpetrators as well as the victims and the bystanders, by focusing on their roles in the occurrence of gross human rights violations., To make the linkage between gross human rights violations and violent conflicts in the world more insightful., To gain an understanding of how to approach the criminological study of complex cases of violence and to be able to analyze such cases independently.. 
Title of the course: Economic Psychology. Increasingly, economists are discovering psychology as a means to enrich their models of economic behavior and well-being.The importance of this is illustrated by the fact that the Nobel Prize winner in economics in 2002 was the distinguished psychologist Daniel Kahneman.He characterizes his research as a quest for the 'logic of the irrational'.Adam Smith already recognized that economic behavior, just like other behavior, is motivated by an intriguing blend of 'rational' considerations and 'irrational' sentiments.The great challenge is to investigate the implications of the latter motives for economics.This course aims at giving an intensive introduction into this field.The first part of the course provides an overview of the psychology of judgment and decision-making.Basic principles of rational decision-making are compared with actual behavior.
Title of the course: Economic Psychology. The second part of the course deals with applications of how psychological mechanisms influence economic decision-making in the field and their relevance for law and public policy.Students should realize that this course is not easy and that its material also includes some mathematical derivations..

The Economic Psychology has the following ILOs: To familiarize students with basic concepts, theories, and insights of the economic psychology of judgment and decision-making.. 
Title of the course: International Economic Relations: the Case of Europe. In this course, we investigate international economic relations, with a particular focus on the European Union (EU) and the euro area (EA).We discuss the channels through which nations are economically connected.This involves analyzing the dynamics of international markets for products and services, labor and finance, and the importance of the underlying institutional designs.We study the underlying economic theory and the way such insights have been translated into the institutional arrangements of the European Union.We discuss how the effects of macroeconomic policies are transmitted from country to country through these channels and how fiscal and monetary policies can/should be coordinated to contribute to fostering economic integration.Finally, we turn to both the intra-European dynamics and the relation of Europe with the rest of the world..

The International Economic Relations: the Case of Europe has the following ILOs: To be able to understand and analyze the institutional design of the EU and the EA and their role in cross-country economic relations., To understand theories of economic and financial integration and apply them to understand cross-country dynamics within the EU/EA and between the EU/EA and the rest of the world., To understand and use the role and impact of macroeconomic policies on economic and financial integration., Understand the challenges for European integration and be able to discuss possible policy solutions.. 
Title of the course: American Foreign Policy. Everyone seems to have an opinion on American foreign policy, however, these opinions are often influenced by emotion or rhetoric.This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the history, process, and sources of American foreign policy so that opinions can be formed on a solid foundation.The course is divided into four sections.The first section will focus on foreign policy analysis as a subfield within International Relations.It will provide an overview of various analytical perspectives on U.S.foreign policy and emphasize the importance of studying American foreign policy in today's world.Section two will delve into the history of U.S.
Title of the course: American Foreign Policy. foreign policy, covering significant events such as the Founding of the United States, World War I, the interwar years, World War II, the rise of a Superpower, the Cold War, the Post-Cold War era, September 11th, and recent world events including the Iraq War, the Global War on Terror, and the presidency of Donald J.Trump.Part three will examine the politics and policy-making process involved in American foreign policy.This section will discuss the various institutions that play a role in the policy-making process, including the President, bureaucratic agencies like the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the CIA, as well as Congress and the Courts.It will also consider the influence of the American public in shaping U.S.foreign policy.The final part of the course will explore the instruments used to implement American foreign policy.

The American Foreign Policy has the following ILOs: To understand the history, the political process in which policy is made, and the policy content of American foreign policy.. 
Title of the course: Contemporary Social Theory. Many people, both ordinary individuals and scientists, have a strong dislike for theory.However, they cannot deny its importance and the fact that they depend on it in their lives.At the end of the day, theory serves as a structured form of communication through which people try to make sense of their social realities.This quote by Charles Lemert emphasizes the significance of theory in understanding the world we live in.This course serves as the second part of a series that aims to explore the historical development of social theory.The first part of the series, known as Classical Social Theory, focuses on social theories up until the 1930s.In contrast, this specific course will delve into social theories that have emerged between the 1960s and the year 2000.
Title of the course: Contemporary Social Theory. During this period, there have been significant changes in the historical context, leading to the inclusion of new perspectives from the Global South, the rise of women's movement, and various other social movements such as environmentalism and LGBTQ+ rights advocacy.The 1960s pushed social theorists to pay more attention to processes of social change, social inequality, marginalization, and exploitation.They also examined power relations and the social movements that challenge them, as well as cultural and other differences among different individuals and groups.In this course, several major theoretical frameworks in modern social science will be introduced, including the Frankfurt School, Symbolic Interactionism, Post-structuralism, Feminism (specifically Standpoint Theory and Ecofeminism), and Post-colonial Theory.
Title of the course: Contemporary Social Theory. The works of influential social theorists like Herbert Marcuse, Patricia Hill Collins, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Pierre Bourdieu will form the foundation of our discussions.While reading original works by these theorists can be challenging, it is also an intellectually stimulating task.It allows students to form their own opinions about the ideas presented by these theorists.Throughout the course, we will explore various questions, such as how we can understand the social world, the impact of capitalism on our social reality, the construction of social reality, the causes of social change, the relationship between agency and structure, and the production of knowledge and by whom.An essential component of the course involves applying different theoretical approaches to social phenomena, enabling us to examine the world around us through the lens of these theories.
Title of the course: Contemporary Social Theory. By doing so, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the social world and the factors that shape it..

The Contemporary Social Theory has the following ILOs: To become familiar with social theories in the 20th century as well as to analyze, apply, compare, and criticize those theories., To discuss what a theory is, how we can theorize, and how theories can illuminate real social problems or issues.. 
Title of the course: Identities. Identity is about one's sense of self.It is about personhood and what kind of person one is.Identities always involve both sameness and difference.If you are Dutch, for example, you are similar to other Dutch people but different from non-Dutch individuals.There is a common belief that identities are fixed or inherent, but sociologists argue that identities are fluid and can change.We can also acquire new identities.In this course, we will explore theoretical texts that discuss the historical, cultural, and political construction of social identities.We will specifically focus on class, gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality as historically specific and structured relations of oppression and exploitation.We will examine how these identities exist and interact with each other.Our discussions and analyses will be centered around how social identities function as overlapping categories of both inclusion and exclusion.
Title of the course: Identities. We will also explore how identities are used to divide, rank, and discriminate.Some of the questions we will address include: What are the main levels of analysis for exploring the interplay between these exploitative and oppressive relations? What are the theoretical, cultural, ideological, and political implications of these relations? 

This course is designed for students who have a genuine interest in the topic and who are open to critically evaluating and understanding their own participation within structures of domination and oppression.We will examine and question how heterosexuality, whiteness, and class privilege, for instance, contribute to maintaining systems of oppression.We will also discuss ways to actively participate in the struggles against identity-based forms of domination..

The Identities has the following ILOs: To learn how different categories of social identities operate as categories of socio-structural inequality., To discuss perspectives on race, ethnicity, class, gender, and national identities in order to gain a better understanding of what they are and how they are conceptualized theoretically., To learn about and reflect on how you, yourself, your thinking, and your way of being are affected by these relations of oppression and domination in everyday life.. 
Title of the course: Economics and Society in Contemporary Asia. This course focuses on the intersection of economics, politics, and culture in Asian societies.The course transcends the borders of academic disciplines and includes topics such as long-run economic development, intra-regional cooperation, social change, political and economic institutions, and the changing global role of Asian countries.We pay attention to topical issues such as trade and financial relations between China and the rest of the world..

The Economics and Society in Contemporary Asia has the following ILOs: The goal of this course is to understand economic issues and economic developments in contemporary Asian societies in their social, cultural, and political context.. 
Title of the course: Urbanisation, Development and Poverty. Since 2008, according to the United Nations Population Division, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas.Over a billion of these city dwellers live in informal settlements (slums), where poverty and precarity are highly concentrated.Nevertheless, people continue to migrate to cities and primarily to informal settlements.Despite their vulnerability to disaster, disease, violence, and cultural tensions, they also appear to be focal points of vitality, opportunity, and new initiatives.In many ways, 'the city' can be conceptualized as a contested site, a compact 'laboratory' where many of the tensions and opportunities related to globalization and development are acted out.Through lectures from ongoing research and selected readings, this course delves into the human aspects of these sites that embody contrasts and contradictions of social, economic, and political processes in cities of the Global South.
Title of the course: Urbanisation, Development and Poverty. We discuss connections and tensions between urban communities and economic development; the creation of vulnerable populations through urbanization and the precariousness of labor; the structural failures of slum ecologies and how they affect people, but also how citizens nevertheless find ways of making the city their home.In short, we aspire to infuse you with both how development and poverty of urban contexts are structurally reproduced in highly political ways and how 'cityness' also always depends on people who manage to flexibly and inventively arrange their lives on a daily basis..

The Urbanisation, Development and Poverty has the following ILOs: After the completion of this course, students will have acquired knowledge about the impacts of urbanization on development and poverty in an increasingly globalized world. In particular, they will learn about:, Multifaceted impacts of global urbanization, including economic, ecological, and social challenges and opportunities of increasingly populated cities., Impoverished conditions of many city dwellers in the Global South, as experienced through access to infrastructure, mobility, public spaces, and diversity., Development impacts and potentials are created by the interconnectedness between global cities.. 
Title of the course: Human Rights: Principles and Polemics. There is the expectation that in an increasingly multicultural and post-secular world, human rights provide us with some common ground: however turbulent and changeable social life may be, we can all demand and enjoy the protection of human rights.This expectation might turn out to be misguided.Even within the “West,” there is intractable disagreement as to the content and implications of human rights.Activities that are seen as human rights violations by some legal systems are tolerated by others.Even more, activities that are seen to be human rights violations by some legal systems are seen to be rightful exercises of freedom by others.How deep are these disagreements? Can they be overcome? 

This course will provide students with an advanced introduction to the field of human rights.It covers two aspects.
Title of the course: Human Rights: Principles and Polemics. First, it covers the “dogmatic core” of human rights law, which includes topics such as the sources of the status of human rights law in international law, who benefits from human rights (individual human beings exclusively, or also corporations or collectives?), what happens when human rights conflict? Naturally, my freedom stops when your freedom starts, but how do we draw the line between different claims to freedom? What happens when human rights clash with the public interest? Can human rights be abused? The second part of the course explores polemics in the field of human rights.These include the legality of the limits of free speech, the proliferation of rights, the scope of the prohibition on discrimination, and the meaning of human dignity.This part of the course will be based on the exploration of contrasting judicial decisions extracted from a variety of international and domestic courts.
Title of the course: Human Rights: Principles and Polemics. This part of the course aims to show that it may be premature to speak of “a human rights community.” Human rights mean different things for different people, and even the appointed experts are often unable to reach an agreement.This course is predominantly legal in character.That means that social scientific explanation and understanding will not be the focus of the course.Rather, the course will concentrate on analyzing the justification of legal decisions in accordance with legal rules and principles..

The Human Rights: Principles and Polemics has the following ILOs: Provides students with an advanced introduction to human rights., Introduces key concepts that are used within all forms of human rights discourse., Familiarize students with polemics in the field of human rights., Provides students an opportunity to engage with the intricacies of legal reasoning., To encourage critical thinking and appreciation of differences within the field of human rights.. 
Title of the course: Contemporary Critical Security Studies. Security Studies during the Cold War were rather limited and narrow, primarily focusing on state security and defining threats solely in military terms.However, as new threats to human well-being and security emerged during the end of the Cold War period, new schools of thought also arose in the field of Security Studies.Today, Contemporary Critical Security Studies encompasses a wide range of scholars, schools, approaches, and understandings.This course explores various schools and approaches within Contemporary Critical Security Studies.It begins with an introduction to conventional security, namely Realism and Liberalism, but also explains why these approaches were deemed unsatisfactory by the academic community in the early 1990s.
Title of the course: Contemporary Critical Security Studies. The course then delves into different theoretical positions, ranging from constructivism to Feminism (gender security), Green Theory (environmental security), and Post-Colonialism (security from non-Western perspectives).Additionally, the course introduces contemporary concepts such as 'Securitisation,' which was developed by the Copenhagen School, and examines 'security networks' or 'security apparatus' as investigated by the Paris or Sociological school.Another relevant contemporary approach discussed is called 'Human Security,' with a focus on the development of this concept.Overall, the course aims to provide students of International Relations with an understanding of how Critical Security Studies has evolved as a distinct sub-field within the discipline.This development owes much to the contributions of the Wales or Aberystwyth Schools.
Title of the course: Contemporary Critical Security Studies. Additionally, the course explores several contemporary issues such as poverty, migration, borders, cyberwar, new technologies and warfare, responsibility to protect, humanitarian intervention, the war against terror, and other contemporary security issues, offering students a broader perspective on the practical application of theories and approaches..

The Contemporary Critical Security Studies has the following ILOs: To understand 'security' in International Relations (IR) as a complex concept with changing meanings and applications., To critically discuss the consequences of different interpretations of security., To deconstruct the given notions and policies about security, and ask questions like what is included, excluded, legitimized, and justified in them., To illuminate the main theoretical assumptions of several approaches to security studies in IR, with a main focus on the more contemporary and critical ones., To explore how contemporary or critical security studies challenge traditional security studies., To discuss the ways contemporary security approaches compare and contrast with each other., To emphasize the empirical application and practical use of such approaches, let's discuss each approach with a relevant case study.. 
Title of the course: The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction. The course will first introduce and define the field of transitional justice.We will look into its historical evolution and address the rationales underlying it.The introduction furthermore includes an overview of the main mechanisms/components that can be part of the process of transitional justice and how they are interrelated.The course will subsequently address several of these transitional justice mechanisms, and in this analysis, we will predominantly focus on the perspectives of the victims.Victims (and survivors) are not only a group but also individual human beings, and their wishes and interests in the aftermath of large-scale conflict can be very diverse and even contradict the wishes of other victims or the group as such.
Title of the course: The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction. What are their interests and what are their views on transitional justice, including possibilities of remedy and reparation? In this context, specific attention is given to the impact of violent conflict on women and children.Throughout the course, critical attention is paid to the following justice mechanisms: apologies and forgiveness, memorialization and commemoration, truth-telling and truth commissions, pardons and amnesties, compensation, restoration, restitution, international and regional criminal courts and tribunals, lustration and vetting.The analysis will be concluded with a discussion of the various justice mechanisms and their potential to contribute to (or jeopardize) sustainable peace.
Title of the course: The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction. How effective are these approaches in breaking cycles of violence? Can they bring reconciliation? 

In addition to issues such as justice and reconciliation, other matters are also significant in post-conflict societies as they greatly affect the consolidation of peace and stability.Justice and reconciliation only form one pillar of reconstruction, but also in other areas, constructive action is required.Such other areas of concern include, for instance, security, well-being, and governance.The course therefore looks into the process of reconstruction and discusses which actions are required in order to move from the precarious early stages of post-conflict transition to a more sustainable situation that allows for the consolidation of peace and stability.Several lectures will be held during this course.
Title of the course: The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice.During the lectures, various guest speakers will address the subject matter from the practitioner’s perspective.In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post-discussion.We hope that, through these documentaries, the subject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract.Case studies play an important role throughout the course, and we will, therefore, pay attention to a wide variety of cases, including the Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armenia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.).
Title of the course: The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction. Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide, and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well.Here one could think of the following cases: Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, East Timor, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Central African Republic, etc.Not to forget the torture practices of the U.S..

The The Aftermath of Atrocity: A Course on Transitional Justice and Post-conflict Reconstruction has the following ILOs: An understanding of transitional justice and how to deal with grave historical injustices from the past is essential. Although the course addresses the roles of many different actors, the role of the victim will receive more substantial attention., To examine different approaches to post-conflict justice (retributive, restorative, and transformative approaches) and their policy implications., To provide a critical overview of different instruments for transitional justice, such as apologies and forgiveness, memorialization and commemoration, truth-telling and truth commissions, impunity, pardons and amnesties, compensation, restoration, restitution of property (especially looted and stolen art), international and regional criminal courts and tribunals, lustration, and vetting, etc., and to examine their impact and effectiveness., An understanding of issues in post-conflict reconstruction focuses on the challenges (military, political, and social) that post-conflict societies face and how they impact the consolidation of peace and stability.. 
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. The recent revival of economic nationalism in various parts of the world, including in some of the traditional pillars of trade liberalization such as the United States and United Kingdom, reflects the growing fear, mistrust, and hostility of many people in these countries and around the world regarding economic globalization and international trade.While economic globalization, in general, and international trade, in particular, undoubtedly offer the possibility of unprecedented prosperity for people in both developed and developing countries, they also cause numerous problems and give rise to justified concerns.The challenge facing the international community is to manage and regulate economic globalization and international trade so that they benefit all of humankind.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. The World Trade Organization, established in 1995, is at the forefront of the multilateral effort to manage and regulate economic globalization in general and international trade in particular.The law of the WTO governs the trade relations between the WTO’s 164 Members but also concerns each of us directly, as it affects the price and quality of the goods and services we consume.Moreover, for many of us, our (future) job will be, directly or indirectly, related to (and sometimes threatened by) international trade.WTO rules have played an important role in mitigating the consequences of the 2008-9 Global Financial and Economic Crisis.In the face of the dramatic drop in production and exports as well as high unemployment experienced by many countries during the 2008-9 crisis, it was feared that countries would resort to trade protectionist measures to support their domestic industries.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the adoption of such protectionist measures deepened and lengthened the economic crisis considerably, which in turn led to political upheaval and radicalization, international tension, and eventually, war.The WTO and its rules have contributed much to the fact that countries did not, in a significant manner, resort to disruptive protectionism in response to the Global Financial and Economic Crisis and that history did not repeat itself.However, continued vigilance is called for because unemployment, poverty, and inequality persist in many countries leading to pressure on governments by domestic industries calling for protection from foreign competition, with the trade war between the US and China being the most prominent example.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the global economy may exacerbate this trend even further unless restrained by Members’ respect for their legal obligations under WTO law.It is clear that WTO rules, most of which were adopted in 1995, are sorely in need of updating to reflect current economic, technological, and societal realities.Since 2001, WTO Members engaged in negotiations in the context of the WTO Doha Development Round on rules for the further liberalization of international trade.To the disappointment of many, several years of negotiations resulted in only limited agreements on new rules for international trade, achieved in Bali in December 2013 and in Nairobi in December 2015.However, in June 2022, at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO, Ministers adopted a package of agreements, including rules on fisheries subsidies and a waiver on patent protection of Covid-19 vaccines.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. Groups of WTO Members continue to work on specific areas such as e-commerce, sustainability, trade and gender, domestic regulation of services, and investment facilitation for development.This introductory course on WTO law and policy is recommended to all students who want to gain a better understanding of the core institutional and substantive rules of the international trading system.This understanding will enable students to also appreciate some other recent developments in the field of international economic law, such as the proliferation of preferential trade agreements and the ongoing trade tensions between major trading powers in the world.Both are a response to the failure of the Doha Development Round to reach multilateral consensus, thereby shifting trade negotiations and actions partly away from the WTO.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. Depending on the political and economic position of the involved states, some of these agreements and actions may well set new standards for future international trade regulation.By taking this course, students will gain an understanding of not just the WTO but also of other recent developments in international economic relations.The course is built around a number of true-to-life international trade problems represented in the form of case studies.The course addresses six themes.It starts by examining the phenomenon of economic globalization and the arguments for and against free trade, as well as the role of law in international economic and trade relations.Secondly, the course looks at the history, objectives, structure, functions, decision-making, and membership of the WTO.Thirdly, the WTO's unique system for the resolution of trade disputes and its current crisis is discussed.
Title of the course: International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments. Fourthly, the principles of non-discrimination in WTO law (namely the obligations of most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment) are examined.Fifthly, the WTO rules on market access, dealing with tariff barriers and some non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services are addressed.Finally, the provisions of WTO law that aim to balance trade liberalization with other societal values (such as health, environment, and security) by means of exceptions to WTO obligations are discussed..

The International Trade Law: Globalization, Trade and Developments has the following ILOs: To gain a better understanding of the World Trade Organization and its basic legal framework,. 
Title of the course: Chinese International Relations and Foreign Policy. The economic and political reforms of the 1980s and 1990s transformed China into the world’s second-largest economy in less than a generation.Its economic growth has allowed the country to seek a more significant role in shaping world politics.In this advanced-level undergraduate course, we are trying to make sense of Chinese international relations and foreign policy -- how China approaches the world and what shapes its external behaviors -- in the contemporary era.This course begins with an introduction, laying out the overall course structure, introducing critical theoretical perspectives and approaches to Western and Chinese international relations theories.Week 2 examines the historical overviews of Chinese foreign policy, as well as the leading domestic debates on it and examines the domestic and international determinants for a changing Chinese foreign policy from 1949 onwards.
Title of the course: Chinese International Relations and Foreign Policy. From Week 3 to 6, some of the core foreign policy interests for China (i.e., national reunification, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, performative legitimacy, and international recognition and status) are examined with corresponding country/region case studies.Week 3 and 4 examine China’s relationship with its nearest neighbors (i.e., Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula) and significant countries in Northeast and Southeast Asia, illustrating the critical challenges to Chinese national interests that occur on its border.Week 5 looks into Chinese relations with the U.S, exploring the development of the Sino-U.S relations, U.S military presence in Asia, the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia, and also the recent Sino-U.S trade war.
Title of the course: Chinese International Relations and Foreign Policy. Week 6 takes a closer look at Chinese participation in international and regional institutions, identifying the general pattern of Chinese behaviors in the multilateral setting.The course is then wrapped up in the final debate on the future role of China in the global order..

The Chinese International Relations and Foreign Policy has the following ILOs: Explain the major Chinese foreign policy developments since 1949., Analyze theoretical approaches in the examination of Chinese foreign policy through data interpretation and information gathering., demonstrate critical thinking skills in evaluating China’s modern relationship with countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the U.S., Develop effective essay writing skills.. 
Title of the course: Innovation Systems, Policy and Sustainability Transitions. The issues that the political-economic systems create while moving forward with a multitude of attempts in structuring our everyday lives and possible futures continue to systematically socialize negative economic, environmental, and social impacts over us and the world society.A much-needed global societal transition towards alternative settings calls for a comprehensive understanding and the analysis of the workings of the multi-scalar socio-technical systems.Accelerating the evolutionary scientific, technological, and social sustainability transitions towards alternative societal futures requires a holistic, interdisciplinary, and critical know-how, which will be introduced by a set of lectures and enhanced by participatory discussions.
Title of the course: Innovation Systems, Policy and Sustainability Transitions. Lectures and discussions are supplemented by optional multi-method research, entrepreneurial mentoring, critical advocacy, and evidence-based policy writing skills sessions.After completing this course, participants will acquire a working knowledge of ideas, interests, and institutions of societal relevance and be able to design new actions or policies for change-making in varieties of systems, sciences, innovations, transitions, economies, contexts, and ultimately, on sustainability outcomes..

The Innovation Systems, Policy and Sustainability Transitions has the following ILOs: To gain holistic, interdisciplinary, and critical knowledge in the analysis of Varieties of systems of innovation and sustainability transitions from political, economic, and societal perspectives, which integrate economic, social, environmental, as well as policy perspectives., To gain holistic, interdisciplinary, and critical knowledge in the analysis of varieties of systems (e.g. technological, regional, socio-technical systems), entrepreneurship (e.g. technological, social, environmental), sciences in systems (e.g. natural and social sciences), innovations (e.g. technological, social, environmental, eco-innovations), transitions (e.g. technological, regional, societal, sustainability transitions), and alternative economies (e.g. circular economy, social economy, digital economy, bio-economy, sharing economy)., To gain holistic, interdisciplinary, and critical knowledge in the analysis of Varieties of systems and transitions from a global perspective (e.g. contexts and cases of high and middle/low-income countries, emerging markets and powers, international cooperation in between)., To gain holistic, interdisciplinary, and critical knowledge in the analysis of Varieties of systems and transitions from a human perspective (e.g. varieties of entrepreneurship and of outcomes, e.g. agency, quality of life, well-being, happiness, peace)., To acquire an evidence-based approach for different policy analysis and design styles, and formulation techniques, on how to write a policy brief in practice.. 
Title of the course: China and India in Global Governance. This course examines the emerging roles of non-Western actors in institutions of global governance.While traditional scholars of international relations focused on relations between sovereign states, this course addresses the questions of governance in a globalizing world through an examination of the interactions between international organizations (IOs) and sovereign states in shaping the contemporary global order.Given that major IOs have been led by Western powers, exploring the emerging roles of China and India in the Western-centric governance architecture is of particular interest to us.These two Asian giants have experienced unprecedented economic growth in the past decades as they have integrated more with the market economy since the 1980s.
Title of the course: China and India in Global Governance. Their emerging roles as global players were acknowledged in the US National Intelligence Council’s report in 2005, stating, “In the same way that commentators refer to the 1900s as the 'American Century,' the 21st century may be seen as a time when Asia, led by China and India, comes into its own.” 

We will start off by introducing the theoretical and historical perspectives on global governance.Week 2 will illustrate the rise and decline of American-led liberal international order.Acknowledging the rise of emerging powers in the current world order, Week 3 will discuss the changes of Chinese and Indian foreign policy strategies in international institutions and the rationales for their engagement.
Title of the course: China and India in Global Governance. Focusing on the selected section of regimes, including climate change, infectious diseases, trade, and also foreign aid, Week 4 and 5 will examine the ways in which China and India engage to the existing global governance architecture, the tools they use, and the efforts they make to influence or redesign current Western-led international institutions.Week 6 will take a closer look at the involvement of China and India in regional institutions, such as Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).While the Chinese and Indian leadership has contributed to regional governance, key security challenges presented by the rising powers to their neighboring countries in Asia, such as territorial disputes and river basin management, will also be highlighted.
Title of the course: China and India in Global Governance. Week 7 will wrap up the course by considering the future of global governance: Can China and India collaborate on emerging global governance challenges? Are they strategic partners or strategic rivals?.

The China and India in Global Governance has the following ILOs: Explain the evolution of global governance and the key challenges facing governance in an increasingly globalized context., Analyze the impacts of emerging powers, China and India, on major Western-led international institutions and agreements., Explain the similarities and differences between Chinese and Indian foreign policy strategies in international institutions., Apply relevant theoretical and conceptual knowledge to examine real-life cases and issues at the global and regional levels., Develop effective essay writing skills. Teaching and learning activities include lectures, tutorial group discussions, individual study, and feedback.. 
Title of the course: Extractivism and Environmental Justice in Latin America and the Global South. Extractivism is a term used by activists and scholars to describe the rise of large-scale, export-driven, capital-intensive resource extraction projects, which includes mining, fossil fuels, and agro-industries.Many countries and regions have embraced extractivism as a means of pursuing "development." This course aims to analyze the phenomenon of extractivism and related development megaprojects within the context of neoliberal and post-neoliberal economies in the Global South.While the focus will primarily be on Latin America, case studies from all regions of the Global South may be included.We will examine environmental controversies stemming from community disputes over land, water, and local autonomy.
Title of the course: Extractivism and Environmental Justice in Latin America and the Global South. Additionally, we will study the responses of both governments and corporations to rising social protests and society's call for better practices, sustainability, and more equitable distribution of wealth.Our analysis will be rooted in the perspective of political ecology and environmental justice, as well as the disciplines of anthropology and human geography.Tasks will delve into various topics, such as the concept of "underdevelopment," Environmental Impact Assessments, Corporate Social Responsibility, the legal frameworks available to ethnic minorities, the contradictions related to the economic valuation of socio-environmental impacts, and the relationship between scientific knowledge and local knowledge, among others.
Title of the course: Extractivism and Environmental Justice in Latin America and the Global South. We will give special attention to concepts, theories, and alternative approaches that emerge through the collaboration of local communities, activists, and critical scholars.Furthermore, we will reflect on the valuable lessons that can be learned from the experiences of social movements in a world increasingly challenged by climate change, resource depletion, and human rights concerns..

The Extractivism and Environmental Justice in Latin America and the Global South has the following ILOs: Understand the tensions and dilemmas in the so-called Global South concerning development and resource extraction, focusing on Latin American countries., Identify the social and environmental consequences of natural resource extraction and development mega-projects, the triggers of social conflict, the diversity of activists' demands, and the state and corporations' responses., Become acquainted with the fields of political ecology, environmental justice, and critical studies of development and extractivism., Explain and reflect on a topic of your choice related to extractivism and development in the Global South.

Extractivism and development in the Global South have been intertwined for decades, with both positive and negative implications. Extractivism refers to the practice of extracting natural resources, such as oil, minerals, and timber, from the earth for commercial purposes. This practice has often been tied to development, as it provides countries with valuable resources that can generate economic growth and improve living standards.

However, the relationship between extractivism and development is complex and controversial. 
Title of the course: Understanding and Tackling Violence.
